be necessary, were never revealed for any reason."},{"id":81,"text":"Surgeons, whose incomes were considerably higher than those of the Chairman himself, were paid so well, in part, because they were virtually ostracized from polite society."},{"id":82,"text":"After all, they knew."},{"id":83,"text":"It was all part of the Spacer fixation on long life, on their unwillingness to admit that old age existed, but Gladia didn't linger on any analysis of causes."},{"id":84,"text":"She was restlessly, uneasy in thinking about herself in that connection."},{"id":85,"text":"If she had a three

Fastolfe died (his end hastened, perhaps, by despair), he had willed everything to the city of Eos, which was a common enough state of affairs."},{"id":91,"text":"Two items, however, he had left to, Gladia (aside from confirming her in the ownership of her establishment and its robots and other chattels, together with the grounds thereto appertaining)."},{"id":92,"text":"One of them had been Daneel."},{"id":93,"text":"Gladia asked, \"Do you remember everything you have ever committed to memory over the course of twenty decades, Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said gravely, \"I believe so,

doesn't follow at all,\" said Gladia. \"You might well remember knowing it, but be unable to think of it at the moment."},{"id":95,"text":"I have frequently had something at the tip of my tongue, so to speak, and been unable to retrieve it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"I do not understand, madam."},{"id":96,"text":"If I knew something, surely it would be there when I needed it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Perfect retrieval?\" They were walking slowly toward the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Merely retrieval, madam."},{"id":97,"text":"I am designed so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For how much longer?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I mean, how much will your brain hold?"},{"id":98,"text":"With a little over twenty decades of accumulated memories, how much longer can it go on?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, madam."},{"id":99,"text":"As yet I feel no difficulty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You might not-until you suddenly discover you can remember no more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel seemed thoughtful for a moment. \"That may be so, madam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You know, Daneel, not all your memories are equally important.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cannot judge among them, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Others can."},{"id":100,"text":"It would be perfectly possible to clean out your brain, Daneel, and then, under supervision, refill it with its important memory content only-say, ten percent of the whole."},{"id":101,"text":"You would then be able to continue for centuries longer than you would otherwise."},{"id":102,"text":"With repeated treatment of this sort, you could go on indefinitely."},{"id":103,"text":"It is an expensive procedure, of course, but I would not cavil at that."},{"id":104,"text":"You'd be worth it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Would I be consulted on the matter, madam?"},{"id":105,"text":"Would I be asked to agree to such treatment?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Of course."},{"id":106,"text":"I would not order you in a matter like that."},{"id":107,"text":"It would be a betrayal of Dr."},{"id":108,"text":"Fastolfe's trust.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, madam."},{"id":109,"text":"In that case, I must tell you that I would never submit voluntarily to such a procedure unless I found myself to have actually lost my memory function.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had reached the door and Gladia paused."},{"id":110,"text":"She said, in honest puzzlement, \"Why ever not, Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said in a low Voice, \"There are memories I cannot risk losing, madam, either through inadvertence or through poor judgment on the part of those conducting the procedure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Like the rising and setting of the stars?"},{"id":111,"text":"Forgive me, Daneel, I didn't mean to be joking."},{"id":112,"text":"To what memories are you referring?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, his voice still lower, \"Madam, I refer to my memories of my onetime partner, the Earthman Elijah Baley \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Gladia stood there, stricken, so that it was Daneel who had to take the initiative, finally, and signal for the door to open."},{"id":113,"text":"Robot Giskard Reventlov was waiting in the living room and Gladia greeted him with that same pang of uneasiness that always assailed her when she faced him."},{"id":114,"text":"He was primitive in comparison with Daneel."},{"id":115,"text":"He was obviously a robot-metallic, with a face that had nothing human in expression upon it, with eyes, that glowed a dim red, as could be seen if it were dark enough."},{"id":116,"text":"Whereas Daneel wore clothing, Giskard had only the illusion of clothing but a skillful illusion, for it was Gladia herself who had designed it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, Giskard,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Good evening, Madam Gladia,\" said Giskard with a small bow of his head."},{"id":117,"text":"Gladia remembered the words of Elijah Baley long ago, like a whisper inside the recesses of her brain:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Daneel will take care of you."},{"id":118,"text":"He will be your friend as well as protector and you must be a friend to him -for my sake."},{"id":119,"text":"But it is Giskard I want you to listen to."},{"id":120,"text":"Let him be your adviser.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia had frowned. \"Why him?"},{"id":121,"text":"I'm not sure I like him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do not ask you to like him."},{"id":122,"text":"I ask you to trust him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he would not say why."},{"id":123,"text":"Gladia tried to trust the robot Giskard, but was glad she did not have to try to like him."},{"id":124,"text":"Something about him made her shiver."},{"id":125,"text":"She had both Daneel and Giskard as effective parts of her establishment for many decades during which Fastolfe had held titular ownership."},{"id":126,"text":"It was only on his deathbed that Han Fastolfe had actually transferred ownership."},{"id":127,"text":"Giskard was the second item, after Daneel, that Fastolfe had left Gladia."},{"id":128,"text":"She had said to the old man, \"Daneel is enough, Han."},{"id":129,"text":"Your daughter Vasilia would like to have Giskard."},{"id":130,"text":"I'm sure of that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFastolfe was lying in bed quietly, eyes closed, looking more peaceful than she had seen him look in years."},{"id":131,"text":"He did not answer immediately and for a moment she thought he had slipped out of\" life so quietly that she had not noticed."},{"id":132,"text":"She tightened her grip on his hand convulsively and his eyes opened."},{"id":133,"text":"He whispered, \"I care nothing for my biological daughters, Gladia."},{"id":134,"text":"For twenty centuries, I have had but one functional daughter and that has been you."},{"id":135,"text":"I want you to have Giskard."},{"id":136,"text":"He is valuable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why is he valuable?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say, but I have always found his presence consoling."},{"id":137,"text":"Keep him always, Gladia."},{"id":138,"text":"Promise me that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I promise,\" she said."},{"id":139,"text":"And then his eyes opened one last time and his voice, finding a final reservoir of strength, said, in almost a natural tone of voice, \"I love you, Gladia, my daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Gladia said, \"I love you, Han, my father.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose were the last words he said and heard."},{"id":140,"text":"Gladia found herself holding the hand of a dead man and, for a while, could not bring herself to let go."},{"id":141,"text":"So Giskard was hers."},{"id":142,"text":"And yet he made her uneasy and she didn't know why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, Giskard, \" she said, \"I've been trying to see Solaria in the sky among the stars, but Daneel tells me it won't be visible till

hours?"},{"id":144,"text":"What do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I suggest, Madam Gladia, that you would be better off in bed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia bridled, \"Indeed?"},{"id":145,"text":"And if I choose to stay up?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mine is only a suggestion, madam, but you will have a hard day tomorrow and you will undoubtedly regret missing, your sleep if you stay up.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia frowned. \"What's going to make my day hard tomorrow, Giskard?"},{"id":146,"text":"I'm not aware of any forthcoming difficulty."},{"id":147,"text":"Giskard said, \"You have an appointment, madam, with one Levular Mandamus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have?"},{"id":148,"text":"When did that happen?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"An hour ago."},{"id":149,"text":"He photophoned and I took the

you will, confirm it as an order, madam, and make that order as strong and as definite as you can, I will try to obey."},{"id":152,"text":"I may not be, able to."},{"id":153,"text":"In my judgment, you see, you will be doing yourself harm if you cancel the appointment and I must not allow you to come to harm through any action of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Your judgment might just possibly be wrong, Giskard."},{"id":154,"text":"Who is this man that my failure to see him will do me harm?"},{"id":155,"text":"His being a member of the Robotics Institute scarcely makes him important to me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia was perfectly aware of the fact that she was venting spleen at Giskard without much justification."},{"id":156,"text":"She had been upset by the news of Solaria's abandonment and embarrassed by the ignorance, that led her to look for Solaria in a sky that did not contain it."},{"id":157,"text":"Of course, it had been Daneel whose knowledge had made her own lack so obvious and yet she had not railed at him-but, then, Daneel looked human and so Gladia automatically treated him as though he were."},{"id":158,"text":"Appearance was everything."},{"id":159,"text":"Giskard looked like a robot, so one could easily assume he had no feelings to hurt."},{"id":160,"text":"And, to be sure, Giskard did not react at all to Gladia's peevishness. (Neither would Daneel have reacted-if it came to that.) He said, \"I have described Dr."},{"id":161,"text":"Mandamus as a member of the Robotics Institute, but he is perhaps more than that."},{"id":162,"text":"In the last few years, he has been right-hand

aborted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I remember it very well, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That's a relief."},{"id":170,"text":"I was afraid that in twenty decades you had forgotten."},{"id":171,"text":"In those twenty decades, I have had nothing to do with Amadiro or with anyone connected with him and I intend to continue that policy I don't care what harm I may do myself or what the consequences might be."},{"id":172,"text":"I will not see this Dr."},{"id":173,"text":"whoever-he-is and, in the future, do not make appointments in my name without consulting me or, at the very least, without

from him."},{"id":174,"text":"There was silence while she moved away three steps and then Giskard's calm voice said, \"Madam, I must ask you to trust me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia stopped."},{"id":175,"text":"Why did he use that expression?"},{"id":176,"text":"She heard again that long-ago voice, \"I do not ask you to like him."},{"id":177,"text":"I ask you to trust

staggered."},{"id":195,"text":"Twice within the hour now, Elijah Baley had come into the conversation."},{"id":196,"text":"He was long gone now-a short-lived Earthman who had died over sixteen decades before-yet the mere mention of his name could still shake her."},{"id":197,"text":"She said, \"How can things suddenly be that serious?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is not sudden,

standards."},{"id":206,"text":"It was alive, however, with motion and action, for there was much for the robots to do-and they could do it by infrared."},{"id":207,"text":"The establishment had to be put into order after the inevitable disordering effects of a day's activity."},{"id":208,"text":"Supplies had to be brought in, rubbish had to be disposed of, objects had to be cleaned or polished or stored, appliances had to be checked, and, always, there was guard duty."},{"id":209,"text":"There were no locks on any doors; there did not have to be."},{"id":210,"text":"There was no violent crime of any sort on Aurora, either against human beings or against property."},{"id":211,"text":"There could not be anything of the sort, since every establishment-and every human being were, at all times, guarded by robots."},{"id":212,"text":"This was well known and taken for granted."},{"id":213,"text":"The price for such calm was that the robot guards had to remain in place."},{"id":214,"text":"They were never used -but only because they were always there."},{"id":215,"text":"Giskard and Daneel, whose abilities were both more intense and more general than those of the other establishment robots, did not have specific duties, unless one counted as a specific duty that of being responsible for the proper performance of all the other robots."},{"id":216,"text":"At 0300, they had completed their rounds out on the lawn and in the wooded area to make sure that all the outer guards were performing their functions well and that no problems were arising."},{"id":217,"text":"They met near the southern limit of the establishment grounds and for a while they spoke in an abbreviated and Aesopic language."},{"id":218,"text":"They understood each other well, with many decades of communication behind them, and it was not necessary for them to involve themselves in all the elaboration's of human speech."},{"id":219,"text":"Daneel said in an all but unhearable whisper, \"Clouds."},{"id":220,"text":"Unseen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHad Daneel been speaking for human ears, he would have said, \"As you see, friend Giskard, the sky has clouded up."},{"id":221,"text":"Had Madam Gladia waited her chance to see Solaria, she would not, in any case, have succeeded.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Giskard's reply of \"Predicted."},{"id":222,"text":"Interview, rather,\" was the equivalent of \"So much was predicted in the weather forecast, friend Daneel, and might have been used as an excuse to get Madam Gladia to bed early."},{"id":223,"text":"It seemed to me to be more important, however, to meet the problem squarely and to persuade her to permit this interview I have already told you about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me, friend Giskard,\" said Daneel, \"that the chief reason you may have found persuasion difficult is that she has been upset by the abandonment of Solaria."},{"id":224,"text":"I was there once with Partner Elijah when Madam Gladia was still a Solarian and was living there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It has always been my understanding,\" said Giskard, \"that Madam Gladia had not been happy on her home planet; that she left her world gladly and had, at no time, any intention of returning."},{"id":225,"text":"Yet I agree with you that she seems to have been unsettled by the fact of Solaria's history having come to an end.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand this reaction of Madam Gladia,\" said Daneel, \"but there are many times that human reactions do not seem to follow logically from events.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is what makes it difficult to decide, sometimes, what will do a human being harm and what will not.\" Giskard might have said it with a sigh, even a petulant sigh, had he been human."},{"id":226,"text":"As it was, he stated it merely as an unemotional assessment of a difficult situation. \"It is one of the reasons, why it seems to me that the Three Laws of Robotics are incomplete or insufficient.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You have said this before, friend Giskard, and I have tried to believe so and failed,\" said Daneel."},{"id":227,"text":"Giskard said nothing for a while, then, \"Intellectually, I think they must be incomplete or insufficient, but when I try to believe that, I too fail, for I am bound by them."},{"id":228,"text":"Yet if I were not bound by them, I am sure I would believe in their insufficiency.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That is a paradox that I cannot understand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nor can I."},{"id":229,"text":"And yet I find myself forced to express this paradox."},{"id":230,"text":"On occasion, I feel that I am on the verge of discovering what the incompleteness or insufficiency of the Three Laws might be, as in my conversation with Madam Gladia this evening."},{"id":231,"text":"She asked me how failure to keep the appointment might harm her personally, rather than simply cause harm in the abstract, and there was an answer I could not give because it was not within the compass of the Three Laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You gave a perfect answer, friend Giskard."},{"id":232,"text":"The harm done to Partner Elijah's, memory would have affected Madam Gladia deeply.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It was the best answer within the compass of the Three Laws."},{"id":233,"text":"It was not the best answer possible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What was the best answer possible?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, since I cannot put it into words or even concepts as long as I am bound by the Laws.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing beyond the Laws,\" said Daneel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If I were human,\" said Giskard, \"I could see beyond the Laws and I think, friend Daneel, that, you might be able to see beyond them sooner than I would.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, friend Daneel, I have long thought that, although a robot, you think remarkably like a human being.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is not proper to think that,\" said Daneel slowly, almost as though he were in pain. \"You think such things because you can look into human minds."},{"id":234,"text":"It distorts you and it may in the end destroy you."},{"id":235,"text":"That thought is to me an unhappy one."},{"id":236,"text":"If you can prevent yourself from seeing into minds more than you must, prevent it."},{"id":237,"text":"Giskard turned away. \"I cannot prevent it, friend Daneel, I would not prevent it."},{"id":238,"text":"I regret that I can do so little with it because of the Three Laws."},{"id":239,"text":"I cannot probe deeply enough because of the fear that I may do harm."},{"id":240,"text":"I cannot influence directly enough-because of the fear I may do harm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yet you influenced Madam Gladia very neatly, friend Giskard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not truly."},{"id":241,"text":"I might have modified her thinking and made her accept the interview without question, but the human mind is so riddled with complexities that I dare do very little."},{"id":242,"text":"Almost any twist I apply will produce subsidiary twists of whose nature I cannot be certain and which may do harm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yet you did something to Madam Gladia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I did not have to."},{"id":243,"text":"The word 'trust' affects her and makes her more amenable."},{"id":244,"text":"I have noted that fact in the past, but I use the word with the greatest caution, since overuse will surely weaken it."},{"id":245,"text":"I puzzle over this, but I cannot simply burrow for a solution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Because the Three Laws will not permit it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard's eyes seemed to intensify their dim glow. \"Yes."},{"id":246,"text":"At every stage, the Three Laws stand in, my way."},{"id":247,"text":"Yet I cannot modify them-because they stand in my way."},{"id":248,"text":"Yet I feel I must modify them, for I sense the oncoming of catastrophe. \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You have said so before, friend Giskard, but you have not explained the nature of the catastrophe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Because I -do not know the nature."},{"id":249,"text":"It involves the increasing hostility between Aurora and Earth, but how this will evolve into actual catastrophe, I cannot say.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible that there might, after all, be no catastrophe?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do not think so."},{"id":250,"text":"I have sensed, among certain Auroran officials I have encountered an aura of catastrophe-of waiting for triumph."},{"id":251,"text":"I cannot describe this more exactly and I cannot probe deeply for a better description because the Three Laws will not allow me to."},{"id":252,"text":"It is another reason why the interview with Mandamus must take place tomorrow."},{"id":253,"text":"It will give me a chance to study his mind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But if you cannot study it effectively?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Giskard's voice was incapable of showing emotion in the human sense, there was no missing the despair in his words, He said, \"Then that will leave me helpless."},{"id":254,"text":"I can only follow the Laws."},{"id":255,"text":"What else can I do?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Daneel said softly and dispiritedly, \"Nothing else.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia entered her living room at 0815, having purposely-and with a touch of spite -determined to allow Mandamus (she had now reluctantly memorized his name) to wait for her."},{"id":256,"text":"She had also taken particular pains with her appearance and (for the first time in years) had agonized over the gray in her hair and had fleetingly wished -she had followed the almost universal Auroran practice of shade control."},{"id":257,"text":"After all, to look as young and attractive as possible would put this minion of Amadiro's at a further disadvantage."},{"id":258,"text":"She was thoroughly prepared to dislike him at sight was depressingly aware that he might prove, young and attractive, that a sunny face might break into a brilliant smile at her appearance, that she might prove reluctantly attracted to him."},{"id":259,"text":"In consequence, she was relieved at the sight of him, He was young, yes, and probably had not yet completed his first half-century, but he hadn't made the best of that."},{"id":260,"text":"He was tall - perhaps 185 centimeters in height, she judged but too thin."},{"id":261,"text":"It made him appear spindly."},{"id":262,"text":"His hair was a shade too dark for an Auroran, his eyes a rather faded hazel, his face too long, his lips too thin, his mouth too broad, his complexion insufficiently fair."},{"id":263,"text":"But what robbed him of the true appearance of youth was that his expression was too prim, too humorless."},{"id":264,"text":"With a flash of insight, Gladia remembered the historical novels that were such a fad on Aurora (novels that invariably dealt with primitive Earth-which was odd for a world that was increasingly hating Earthpeople) and thought: Why, he's the picture of a Puritan."},{"id":265,"text":"She felt relieved and almost smiled."},{"id":266,"text":"Puritans were usually pictured as villains and, whether this Mandamus was indeed one or not, it was convenient to have him look like one."},{"id":267,"text":"But when he spoke Gladia was disappointed, for his voice was soft and distinctly musical. (It ought to have possessed a nasal twang if it were to fulfill the stereotype.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Mrs."},{"id":268,"text":"Gremionis?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand with a carefully condescending smile. \"Mr."},{"id":269,"text":"Mandamus. -Please call me Gladia."},{"id":270,"text":"Everyone does."},{"id":271,"text":"I know you use your given name professionally----\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I use it in every way."},{"id":272,"text":"And my marriage came to an amicable end several decades ago.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It lasted for a long, time, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A very long time."},{"id":273,"text":"It was a great success, but even great successes come to a natural end.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Mandamus sententiously. \"To continue past the end might well turn -success into failure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia nodded and said with a trace of a smile, \"How wise for one so young. -But shall we move into the dining room?"},{"id":274,"text":"Breakfast is ready and I have surely delayed you long enough.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was, only as Mandamus turned with her and adjusted his steps to hers that Gladia became aware of his two accompanying robots."},{"id":275,"text":"It was quite unthinkable for any, Auroran to go anywhere without a robotic retinue, but as long as robots stood still they made no impression on the Auroran eye."},{"id":276,"text":"Gladia, looking at them quickly, saw that they were late models, clearly expensive."},{"id":277,"text":"Their pseudo-clothing was elaborate and, although it was not of Gladia's design, it was first-class."},{"id":278,"text":"Gladia had to admit so much to herself, though reluctantly- She would have to find out who had designed it someday, for she did not recognize the touch and she might be about to have a new and formidable competitor."},{"id":279,"text":"She found herself admiring the manner in which the style of pseudo-clothing was distinctly the same for both robots, while remaining distinctly individual for each."},{"id":280,"text":"You could not mistake one for the other."},{"id":281,"text":"Mandamus caught her swift look and interpreted her expression with disconcerting accuracy. (He is intelligent, thought Gladia, disappointed.) He said, \"The exodesign of my robots was created by a young man at the Institute who has not yet made a name for himself."},{"id":282,"text":"But he will, don't you think?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Definitely,\" said Gladia."},{"id":283,"text":"Gladia did not expect any business discussion till breakfast was done."},{"id":284,"text":"It would be the height of ill breeding to speak of anything but trivia during meals and Gladia guessed that Mandamus was not at his best with trivia."},{"id":285,"text":"There was the weather, of course."},{"id":286,"text":"The recent siege of rain, now happily done with, was mentioned and the prospects for the oncoming dry season."},{"id":287,"text":"There was the almost mandatory expression of admiration for the hostess's establishment and Gladia accepted it with practiced modesty."},{"id":288,"text":"She did nothing to ease the strain on the man, but let him search for subject matter without help."},{"id":289,"text":"At length, his eye fell on Daneel, standing_ quietly and without motion in his wall niche, and Mandamus managed to overcome his Auroran indifference and notice him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" he said, \"clearly the famous R."},{"id":290,"text":"Daneel Olivaw."},{"id":291,"text":"He's absolutely unmistakable."},{"id":292,"text":"A rather remarkable specimen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Quite remarkable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He's yours now, isn't he?"},{"id":293,"text":"By Fastolfe's will?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"By Doctor Fastolfe's will, yes,\" said Gladia with faint emphasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It strikes me as amazing that the Institute's line of humanoid robots failed as it did."},{"id":294,"text":"Have you, ever thought about it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have heard of it,\" said Gladia cautiously. (Could it be that this was what he was getting around to?) \"I'm not aware of having spent much time thinking about it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sociologists are still trying to understand it."},{"id":295,"text":"Certainly, we at the Institute never got over the disappointment."},{"id":296,"text":"It seemed like such a natural development."},{"id":297,"text":"Some of us think that Fa - Dr."},{"id":298,"text":"Fastolfe somehow had something to do with it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(He had avoided making the mistake a second time, thought Gladia."},{"id":299,"text":"Her eyes narrowed and she grew hostile as she decided he had come to her in order to probe for material damaging to poor, good Han.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe said tartly, \"Anyone who thinks that is a fool."},{"id":300,"text":"If you think so, I won't change the expression for your benefit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am not one of those who thinks so, largely because I don't see what Dr."},{"id":301,"text":"Fastolfe could have done to make it a fiasco.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why should anyone have had to do anything?"},{"id":302,"text":"What it amounts to is that the public didn't want them."},{"id":303,"text":"A robot that looks like a man competes with a man and one that looks like a woman competes with a woman-and entirely too closely for comfort."},{"id":304,"text":"Aurorans didn't want the competition."},{"id":305,"text":"Do we need to look any further.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sexual competition?\" said Mandamus calmly."},{"id":306,"text":"For a moment, Gladia's gaze met his levelly."},{"id":307,"text":"Did he know of her long-ago love for the robot Jander?"},{"id":308,"text":"Did it matter if he did?"},{"id":309,"text":"There seemed nothing in, his expression to make it appear that he meant anything beyond the surface meaning of the words."},{"id":310,"text":"She said finally, \"Competition in every way."},{"id":311,"text":"If Dr."},{"id":312,"text":"Han Fastolfe did anything to contribute to such a feeling, it was that he designed his robots in too human a fashion, but that was the only way.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I think you have thought about the matter,\" said Mandamus. \"The trouble is that, sociologists find the fear of Competition with too-human, a set of robots to be simplistic, as an explanation."},{"id":313,"text":"That alone would not suffice and there is no evidence of any other aversion motive of significance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sociology is not an exact 'science,'\" said Gladia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is not altogether inexact, either.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia shrugged."},{"id":314,"text":"After a pause, Mandamus said, \"In any case, it kept us from organizing colonizing expeditions properly."},{"id":315,"text":"Without humanoid robots to pave the way----\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBreakfast was not quite over, but it was clear to Gladia that Mandamus could not avoid the nontrivial any longer."},{"id":316,"text":"She said, \"We might have gone ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis time it was Mandamus who shrugged. \"Too difficult."},{"id":317,"text":"Besides, those short-lived barbarians from Earth, with the permission of your Dr."},{"id":318,"text":"Fastolfe, have swarmed over every planet in sight like a plague of beetles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There are plenty of available planets still."},{"id":319,"text":"Millions."},{"id":320,"text":"And if they can do it-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Of course they can do it,\" said Mandamus with sudden passion. \"It costs lives, but what, are lives to them?"},{"id":321,"text":"The loss of a decade or so, that's all, and there are billions of them."},{"id":322,"text":"If a million or so die in the, process of colonizing, who notices, who cares?"},{"id":323,"text":"They don't.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure they do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense."},{"id":324,"text":"Our lives are longer and therefore more valuable-and we are naturally more careful with them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So we sit here and do nothing but rail at Earth's Settlers for being willing to risk their lives and for seeming to inherit the Galaxy as a result.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia was unaware of feeling so pro-Settler a bias, but she was in the mood to contradict Mandamus and as she spoke she could not help but feel that what began as mere contradiction made sense and could well represent her feelings."},{"id":325,"text":"Besides, she had heard Fastolfe say similar things during his last discouraged years."},{"id":326,"text":"At Gladia's signal, the table was being rapidly and efficiently cleared."},{"id":327,"text":"Breakfast might have continued, but the conversation and the mood had become quite unsuitable for civilized mealtime,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey moved back into the living room."},{"id":328,"text":"His robots followed and so did Daneel land Giskard, all finding their niches, (Mandamus had never remarked on Giskard, thought Gladia, but then, why should he?"},{"id":329,"text":"Giskard was quite old fashioned and even primitive, entirely unimpressive in comparison to Mandamus's beautiful, specimens.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia took her seat and crossed her legs, quite aware that the form-fitting sheerness of the lower portion of her slacks flattered the still youthful appearance of her legs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"May I know the reason for your wishing to see me, Dr."},{"id":330,"text":"Mandamus?\" she said, unwilling to delay matters any longer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe said, \"I have the bad habit of chewing medicated gum after meals as an aid to digestion."},{"id":331,"text":"Would you object?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia said stiffly, \"I would find it distracting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Being unable to chew might put him at a disadvantage."},{"id":332,"text":"Besides, Gladia added to herself virtuously, at his age he shouldn't need anything to aid his digestion.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus, had a small oblong package partway out of his tunic's breast pocket."},{"id":333,"text":"He shoved it back with no sign of disappointment and murmured, \"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was asking, Dr."},{"id":334,"text":"Mandamus, your reason for wishing to see me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Actually two reasons, Lady Gladia."},{"id":335,"text":"One is a personal matter and one is a matter of state."},{"id":336,"text":"Would you object to my taking up the personal matter first?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Let me say frankly, Dr."},{"id":337,"text":"Mandamus, that I find it hard to imagine what

told.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor of working with Doctor Amadiro,\" he said with faint emphasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(He's paying me back, thought Gladia, but I'm not taking it.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe said, \"Amadiro and I had an occasion for contact twenty decades ago and it was most unpleasant."},{"id":339,"text":"I have had no occasion for any contact with him at any time

that son and daughter, she had, in perfectly decent Spacer fashion, never inquired and did not care."},{"id":354,"text":"Having met one of them, she was Spacer enough still not to care."},{"id":355,"text":"The thought stabilized her completely."},{"id":356,"text":"She sat back in, her chair and relaxed. \"Very well,\" she said. \"You are my descendant in the fifth degree."},{"id":357,"text":"If this is the personal matter you wish to discuss, it is of no importance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I understand that fully, ancestress."},{"id":358,"text":"My genealogy is not, in itself, what I wish to discuss, but it lays the foundation."},{"id":359,"text":"Dr."},{"id":360,"text":"Amadiro, you see, knows of this relationship, At least, so I suspect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?"},{"id":361,"text":"How did that come about?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I believe that he quietly genealogizes all those who come to work at the Institute.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In order to find out exactly what he did find out in my case."},{"id":362,"text":"He is not a trusting man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand."},{"id":363,"text":"If you are my fifth-level descendant, why should it have more meaning to him than it does to me?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus rubbed his chin with the knuckles of his right hand in a thoughtful manner. \"His dislike for you is in no way less than your dislike for him, Lady Gladia."},{"id":364,"text":"If you were ready to refuse an interview with me for his sake, he is equally ready to refuse me preferment for your sake."},{"id":365,"text":"It might be even worse if I were a descendant of Dr."},{"id":366,"text":"Fastolfe, but not much.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia sat stiffly, upright in her seat."},{"id":367,"text":"Her nostrils flared and she said in a tight voice, \"What is it, then, that you expect me to do?"},{"id":368,"text":"I cannot declare you a nondescendant."},{"id":369,"text":"Shall I have an announcement placed on hypervision that you are a matter of indifference to me and that I disown you."},{"id":370,"text":"Will that satisfy your Amadiro?"},{"id":371,"text":"If so, I must warn you I will not do it."},{"id":372,"text":"I will do nothing to satisfy that man."},{"id":373,"text":"If it means that he will discharge you and deprive you of your career out of some sort of disapproval of your genetic association, then that will teach you to associate with a saner, less vicious person,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe will not discharge me, Madam Gladia."},{"id":374,"text":"I am entirely too valuable to him-if you will pardon my immodesty."},{"id":375,"text":"Still, I hope someday to succeed him as head of the Institute and that, I am quite certain, he will not allow, as long as he suspects me of a descent worse than that which stems from YOU.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Does he imagine that poor Santirix is worse than I am?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.\" Mandamus flushed and he swallowed, but his voice remained level and steady. \"I mean no disrespect, madam, but Lowe it to myself to learn the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What truth?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am descended from you in the fifth degree."},{"id":376,"text":"That is clear in the genealogical records."},{"id":377,"text":"But it is possible that I am also descended in the fifth degree, not from Santirix Gremionis but from the Earthman Elijah Baley?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia rose to her feet as quickly as though the undimensional force, fields of a puppeteer had lifted her."},{"id":378,"text":"She was not aware that she had risen."},{"id":379,"text":"It was the third time in twelve hours that the name of that long-ago Earthman had been mentioned -and by three different individuals."},{"id":380,"text":"Her voice seemed not to be hers at all. \"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe said, rising in his turn and backing away slightly, \"It seems to me plain enough."},{"id":381,"text":"Was your son, my great-great-grandfather, born of a sexual union of yourself with the Earthman Elijah Baley?"},{"id":382,"text":"Was Elijah Baley your son's father?"},{"id":383,"text":"I don't know how to express it more plainly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How dare you make such a suggestion?"},{"id":384,"text":"Or even think it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I dare because my career depends upon it."},{"id":385,"text":"If the answer is yes, my professional life may well be ruined."},{"id":386,"text":"I want a 'no' but an unsupported 'no' will do me no good."},{"id":387,"text":"I must be able to present proof to Dr."},{"id":388,"text":"Amadiro at the appropriate time and show him that his disapproval of my genealogy must end with you."},{"id":389,"text":"After all, it is clear to me that his dislike of you-and even of Dr."},{"id":390,"text":"Fastolfe - is as nothing-nothing at all-compared to the incredible intensity of his detestation of the Earthman Elijah Baley."},{"id":391,"text":"It is not only the fact of, his being short-lived, although the thought of having inherited barbarian genes would disturb me tremendously."},{"id":392,"text":"I think that if I presented proof I was descended from, an Earthman who was not Elijah Baley, he would dismiss that."},{"id":393,"text":"But it is the thought of Elijah Baley-and only he-that drives him to madness."},{"id":394,"text":"I do not know why.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reiteration of Elijah's name had made him seem almost alive again to Gladia."},{"id":395,"text":"She was breathing harshly and deeply and she exulted in the best memory of her life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I know why,\" she said. \"It was because Elijah, with everything against him, with all of Aurora against him, managed anyhow to destroy Amadiro at the moment when that man thought he held success in his hand."},{"id":396,"text":"Elijah did it by the exercise of sheer courage and intelligence."},{"id":397,"text":"Amadiro had met his infinite superior in the person of an Earthman he had carelessly despised and what could he do in return but hate futilely?"},{"id":398,"text":"Elijah has been dead for more than sixteen decades and still Amadiro cannot forget, cannot forgive, cannot release the chains that bind him in hate and memory to that dead man."},{"id":399,"text":"And I would not have Amadiro forget or cease hating-as long as it poisons every moment of his existence."},{"id":400,"text":"Mandamus said, \"I see you have reason for wishing Dr."},{"id":401,"text":"Amadiro ill, but what reason have you for wishing me ill?"},{"id":402,"text":"To allow Dr."},{"id":403,"text":"Amadiro to think I am descended from Elijah Baley will give him the pleasure of destroying me."},{"id":404,"text":"Why should you give him that pleasure needlessly, if I am not so descended?"},{"id":405,"text":"Give me the proof, therefore, that I am descended from you and Satitirix Gremionis or from you and anybody but Elijah Baley.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You fool!"},{"id":406,"text":"You idiot!"},{"id":407,"text":"Why do you need proof from me?"},{"id":408,"text":"Go to the historical records."},{"id":409,"text":"You will find the exact days on which Elijah Baley was on Aurora."},{"id":410,"text":"You will find the exact day on which I gave birth to my son, Darrel."},{"id":411,"text":"You will find that Darrel was conceived more than five years after Elijah left Aurora."},{"id":412,"text":"You will also find that Elijah never returned to Aurora."},{"id":413,"text":"Well, then, do you think I gestated for five years, that I carried a fetus in my womb for five Standard Galactic Years?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I know the statistics, madam."},{"id":414,"text":"And I do not think you carried a fetus for five years.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then why do you come to me?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Because there is more to it than that."},{"id":415,"text":"I know-and I imagine that Dr."},{"id":416,"text":"Amadiro well knows-that although the Earthman Elijah Baley, as you say, never returned to Aurora's surface, he was once in a ship that was in orbit about Aurora for a day or so."},{"id":417,"text":"I know - and I imagine that Dr."},{"id":418,"text":"Amadiro well knows-that although the Earthman did not leave the ship to go to Aurora, you left Aurora to go to the ship; that you stayed on the ship for the better part of a day; and that this took place nearly five years after the Earthman had been on Aurora's surface - at about the time, in fact, that your son was conceived.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia felt the blood drain from her face as she heard the other's calm words."},{"id":419,"text":"The room darkened about her and she swayed."},{"id":420,"text":"She felt the sudden, gentle touch of strong arms about her and knew they were those of Daneel."},{"id":421,"text":"She felt herself lowered slowly into her chair."},{"id":422,"text":"She heard Mandamus's voice as though from a great distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is that not true, madam?\" he said."},{"id":423,"text":"It was, of course, true."},{"id":424,"text":"Memory!"},{"id":425,"text":"Always there, of course, but usually remaining hidden."},{"id":426,"text":"And then, sometimes, as a result of just the right kind of push, it could emerge suddenly, sharply defined, all in color, bright and moving and alive."},{"id":427,"text":"She was young again, younger than this man before her; young enough to feel tragedy and love-with her death-in-life on Solaria having reached its climax in the bitter end of the first whom she had thought of as \"husband.\" (No, she would not say his name even now, not, even in thought.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCloser still to her then-life were the months of heaving emotion with the second-not-man- whom she had thought of by that term."},{"id":428,"text":"Jander, the humanoid robot, had been given to her and she had made him entirely her own until, like her first husband, he was suddenly dead."},{"id":429,"text":"And then, at last, there was Eli ah Baley, who was never her husband, whom she had met only twice, two years apart, each time for a few hours on each of a very few days."},{"id":430,"text":"Elijah, whose cheek she had once touched with her ungloved hand, on which occasion she had ignited; whose nude body she had later held in her arms, on which occasion she had flamed steadily at last."},{"id":431,"text":"And then, a third husband, with whom she was quiet and at peace, paying with untriumph for unmisery and buying with firmly held forgetfulness the relief from reliving."},{"id":432,"text":"Until one day (she was not sure of the day that so broke in upon the sleeping untroubled years) Han Fastolfe, having asked permission to visit, walked over from his adjoining establishment."},{"id":433,"text":"Gladia looked upon him with some concern, for he was too busy a man to socialize lightly."},{"id":434,"text":"Only five years had passed since the crisis that had established Han as Aurora's leading statesman."},{"id":435,"text":"He was the Chairman of the planet in all but name and the true leader of all the Spacer worlds."},{"id":436,"text":"He had so little time to be a human being."},{"id":437,"text":"Those years had left their mark-and would continue to do so until he died sadly, considering himself a failure though he had never lost a battle."},{"id":438,"text":"Kelden Amadiro, who had been defeated, lived on sturdily, as evidence that victory can exact the greater penalty."},{"id":439,"text":"Fastolfe, through it all, continued to be soft-spoken and patient and uncomplaining, but even Gladia, nonpolitical though she was and uninterested in the endless machinations of power, knew that his control of Aurora held firm only through constant and unremitting effort that drained him of anything that might make life worthwhile and that he held to it-or was held to it-only by what he considered the good of-what?"},{"id":440,"text":"Aurora?"},{"id":441,"text":"The Spacers?"},{"id":442,"text":"Simply some vague --concept of idealized Good?"},{"id":443,"text":"She didn't know."},{"id":444,"text":"She flinched from asking."},{"id":445,"text":"But this was only five years after the crisis."},{"id":446,"text":"He still gave the impression of a young and hopeful man and his pleasant homely face was still capable of smiling."},{"id":447,"text":"He said, \"I have a message for you, Gladia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A pleasant one, I hope,\" she said politely."},{"id":448,"text":"He had brought Daneel with him."},{"id":449,"text":"It was a sign of the healing of old wounds that she could look at Daneel with honest affection and no pain at all, even though he was a copy of her dead Jander in all but the most insignificant detail."},{"id":450,"text":"She could talk to him, though he answered in what was almost Jander's voice."},{"id":451,"text":"Five years had skinned over the ulcer and deadened the pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" said Fastolfe, smiling gently. \"It's from an old friend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It's so nice that I have old friends,\" she said, trying not to be sardonic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"From Elijah Baley.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe five years vanished and she felt the stab and pang of returning memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is he well?\" she asked in a half-strangled voice after a full minute of stunned silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Quite well."},{"id":452,"text":"What is even more important, he is near.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Near?"},{"id":453,"text":"On Aurora?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In orbit about Aurora."},{"id":454,"text":"He knows he can receive no permission to land, even if I were to use my full influence, or I imagine he does."},{"id":455,"text":"He would like to see you, Gladia."},{"id":456,"text":"He had made contact with me because he feel's that I can arrange to have you visit his ship."},{"id":457,"text":"I suppose I can manage that much-but only if you wish it."},{"id":458,"text":"Do you wish it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I don't now."},{"id":459,"text":"This is too sudden for thought.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Or even impulse?\" He waited, then he said, \"Truthfully, Gladia, how are you getting along with Santirix?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe looked at him wildly, as though not understanding the reason for the change of subject-then understanding."},{"id":460,"text":"She said, \"We get along well together.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Are you happy?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am-not unhappy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't sound like ecstasy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How long can ecstasy last, even if it were ecstasy?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do you plan to have children someday?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Are you planning a change in marital status?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe shook her head firmly. \"Not yet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then, my dear Gladia, if you want advice from a rather tired man, who feels uncomfortably old-refuse the invitation."},{"id":461,"text":"I remember what little you told me after Baley had left Aurora and, to tell you the truth, I was able to deduce more from that than you perhaps think."},{"id":462,"text":"If you see him, you may find it all disappointing, not living up to the deepening and mellowing glow of reminiscence; or, if it is not disappointing, worse yet, for it will disrupt a perhaps rather fragile contentment, which you will then not be able to repair."},{"id":463,"text":"Gladia, who had been vaguely thinking precisely that, found the proposition needed only to be placed into words to be rejected."},{"id":464,"text":"She said, \"No, Han, I must see him, but I'm afraid to, do it alone."},{"id":465,"text":"Would you come with me?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFastolfe smiled wearily. \"I was not invited, Gladia."},{"id":466,"text":"And if I were, I would in any case be forced to refuse."},{"id":467,"text":"There is an important vote coming up in the Council."},{"id":468,"text":"Affairs of state, you know, from which I can't absent myself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Poor Han!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed, poor me."},{"id":469,"text":"But you can't go alone."},{"id":470,"text":"As far as I know, you can't pilot a ship.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oh!"},{"id":471,"text":"Well, I thought I'd be taken up by----\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Commercial carrier?\" Fastolfe shook his head. \"Quite impossible."},{"id":472,"text":"For you- to visit and board an Earth ship in orbit openly, as would be unavoidable if you used commercial carrier, would require special permission and that would take weeks."},{"id":473,"text":"If you don't want to go, Gladia, you needn't put it on the basis of not wishing to see him."},{"id":474,"text":"If the paperwork and red tape involved would take weeks, I'm sure he can't wait that long.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But I do want to see him,\" said Gladia, now determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In that case, you can take my private space vessel and Daneel can take you up there."},{"id":475,"text":"He can handle the controls very well indeed and he is as anxious to see Baley as you are."},{"id":476,"text":"We just won't report the trip.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But you'll get into trouble, Han.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps no one will find out-or they'll pretend not to find out."},{"id":477,"text":"And if anyone makes trouble, I will just have to handle it."},{"id":478,"text":"Gladia's head bowed in a moment of thought and then she said, \"If you don't mind, I will be selfish and chance your having trouble, Han."},{"id":479,"text":"I want to go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then you'll go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a small ship, smaller than Gladia had imagined; cozy in a way, but frightening in another way."},{"id":480,"text":"It was small enough, after all, to lack any provision for pseudo-gravity and the sensation of weightlessness, while constantly nudging at her to indulge in amusing gymnastics, just as constantly reminded her that she was in an abnormal environment."},{"id":481,"text":"She was a Spacer."},{"id":482,"text":"There were over five billion Spacers spread over fifty worlds, all of them proud of the name."},{"id":483,"text":"Yet how many of those who called themselves Spacers were really space travelers?"},{"id":484,"text":"Very few."},{"id":485,"text":"Perhaps eighty percent of them never left the world of their birth."},{"id":486,"text":"Even of the remaining twenty percent, hardly any passed through space more than two or three times."},{"id":487,"text":"Certainly, she-herself was no Spacer in the literal sense of the word, she thought gloomily."},{"id":488,"text":"Once (once!) she had traveled through space and that was from Solaria to Aurora seven years before."},{"id":489,"text":"Now she was entering space a second time on a small private space yacht for a short trip just beyond the atmosphere, a paltry hundred thousand kilometers, with one other person-not even a person-for company."},{"id":490,"text":"She cast another glance at Daneel in the small pilot room."},{"id":491,"text":"She could just see a portion of him, where he sat at the controls."},{"id":492,"text":"She had never been anywhere with only one robot within call."},{"id":493,"text":"There had always been hundreds -thousands -at her disposal on Solaria."},{"id":494,"text":"On Aurora, there were routinely dozens, if not scores\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere there was but one."},{"id":495,"text":"She said, \"Daneel!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe did not allow his attention to wander from the controls. \"Yes, Madam Gladia?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Are you pleased that you will be seeing Elijah Baley again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am not certain, Madam Gladia, how best to describe my inner state."},{"id":496,"text":"It may be that it is analogous to what a human being would describe as being pleased.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But you must feel something.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I feel as though I can make decisions more rapidly than I can ordinarily; my responses seem to come more easily; my movements seem to require less energy."},{"id":497,"text":"I might interpret it generally as a sensation of well-being."},{"id":498,"text":"At least I have heard human beings use that word and feel that what it is intended to describe is something that is analogous to the sensations I now experience.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia said, \"But what if I were to say I wanted to see him alone?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then that would be arranged.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Even though that meant you wouldn't see him?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't you then feel disappointed?"},{"id":499,"text":"I mean, wouldn't you have a sensation that was the opposite of wellbeing?"},{"id":500,"text":"Your decisions would come less rapidly, your responses less easily, your movements would require more energy and so on.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, Madam Gladia, for I would have a feeling of well being at fulfilling your orders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Your own pleasant feeling is Third Law, and fulfilling my orders is Second Law, and Second Law takes precedence."},{"id":501,"text":"Is that it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia struggled against her own curiosity."},{"id":502,"text":"It would never have occurred to her to question an ordinary robot in this matter."},{"id":503,"text":"A robot is a machine."},{"id":504,"text":"But she couldn't think of Daneel as a machine, just as five years before she had been unable to think of Jander as a machine."},{"id":505,"text":"But with, Jander that had been only the burning of passion-and that had gone with Jander himself."},{"id":506,"text":"For all his similarity to the other, Daneel could not set the ashes alight again."},{"id":507,"text":"With him, there was room for intellectual curiosity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't it bother you, Daneel,\" she asked, \"to be so bound by the Laws?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cannot imagine anything else, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All my life I have been bound to the pull of gravity, even during my one previous trip on a spaceship,

uneasy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why, Daneel?"},{"id":509,"text":"Have you ever tried to reason I out to yourself why the thought of Lawlessness should make you feel uneasy?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel was silent for a moment."},{"id":510,"text":"He said, \"I have, madam, but I do not think I would wonder about such things but for my brief associations with, Partner Elijah."},{"id":511,"text":"He had a way\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know,\" she said. \"He wondered about everything."},{"id":512,"text":"He had a restlessness about him that drove him on to ask questions at all times in all directions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So it seemed."},{"id":513,"text":"And I would try to be like him and ask questions."},{"id":514,"text":"So I asked myself what Lawlessness might be like and I found I couldn't imagine what it might be like except that it might be like being human and that made me feel uneasy."},{"id":515,"text":"And I asked myself, as you asked me, why it made me feel uneasy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And what did you answer yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"After a long time, I decided that the Three Laws govern the manner in which my positronic pathways behave."},{"id":516,"text":"At all times, under all stimuli\" the Laws constrain the direction and intensity of positronic flow along those pathways so that I always know what to do."},{"id":517,"text":"Yet the level of knowledge of what to do is not always the same."},{"id":518,"text":"There are times when my doing-as-l-must is under less constraint than at other times."},{"id":519,"text":"I have always noticed that the lower the positronornotive potential, then the further removed from certainty is my decision as to which action to take."},{"id":520,"text":"And the further removed from certainty I am, the nearer I am to ill being."},{"id":521,"text":"To decide an action in a millisecond rather than a nanosecond produces a sensation I would not wish to be prolonged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What then, I thought to myself, madam, if I were utterly without Laws, as humans are?"},{"id":522,"text":"What if I could make no clear decision on what response to make to some given set of conditions?"},{"id":523,"text":"It would be unbearable and I do not willingly think of it."},{"id":524,"text":"Gladia said, \"Yet you do, Daneel."},{"id":525,"text":"You are thinking of it now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Only because of my association with Partner Elijah, madam."},{"id":526,"text":"I observed him under conditions when he was unable, for a time, to decide on an action because of the puzzling nature of the problems that had been set him."},{"id":527,"text":"He was clearly in a state of ill-being as a result and I felt ill-being on his behalf because there was nothing I could do that would ease\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is possible that I only, grasped at the situation for him."},{"id":528,"text":"A very small part of what it was he felt then."},{"id":529,"text":"If I had grasped a larger part and better understood the, consequences of his inability to decide on action, I might have."},{"id":530,"text":"He hesitated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ceased functioning?"},{"id":531,"text":"Been inactivated?\" said Gladia, thinking briefly and painfully of Jander.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam."},{"id":532,"text":"My failure to understand may been an in built protection device against damage to my positronic brain."},{"id":533,"text":"But then, I noted that no matter how painful Partner Elijah found his indecision to be, he continued to make an effort to solve his problem."},{"id":534,"text":"I admired him greatly for that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You are capable of admiration then, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said solemnly, \"I use the word as I have heard human beings use it."},{"id":535,"text":"I do not know the proper word to express the response within me elicited by Partner Elijah's actions of this sort.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia nodded, then said, \"And yet there are rules that govern human reactions, too certain instincts, drives, teachings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So friend Giskard thinks, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Does he now?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But he finds them too complicated to analyze."},{"id":536,"text":"He wonders if there might someday be developed a system of analyzing human behavior in mathematical detail and of deriving-from that-cogent Laws that would express the rules of that behavior.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I doubt it,\" said Gladia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nor is friend Giskard sanguine."},{"id":537,"text":"He thinks it will be a very long time before such a system is developed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A very long time, I should say.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Daneel, \"we are approaching the Earth ship and we must carry through the docking procedure, which is not simple.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Gladia that it took longer to dock than to move into the Earth ship's orbit in the first place,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel remained calm throughout-but, then, he could not do otherwise-and assured her that all human ships could dock with each other regardless of difference in size and make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Like human beings,\" said Gladia, forcing a smile, but Daneel made no response to that."},{"id":538,"text":"He concentrated on the delicate adjustments that had to, be made."},{"id":539,"text":"Docking was always possible, perhaps, but not always easy, it would appear."},{"id":540,"text":"Gladia grew uneasier by the moment."},{"id":541,"text":"Earthmen were short-lived and aged quickly."},{"id":542,"text":"Five years had passed since she had seen Elijah."},{"id":543,"text":"By how much would he have aged?"},{"id":544,"text":"How would, he appear?"},{"id":545,"text":"Would she be able to keep from looking shocked or horrified at the change?"},{"id":546,"text":"Whatever his appearance, he would still be the Elijah to whom her gratitude could know no bounds."},{"id":547,"text":"Was that what it was?"},{"id":548,"text":"Gratitude?"},{"id":549,"text":"She noticed that her hands were tightly entwined with each other, so that her arms were aching."},{"id":550,"text":"It was only with an effort that she could force them to relax."},{"id":551,"text":"She knew when docking was completed."},{"id":552,"text":"The Earth ship was large enough to have a pseudo-gravitation field generator and, at the moment of docking, the field expanded to include the small yacht."},{"id":553,"text":"There was a slight rotational effect as the direction toward the floor suddenly became \"down\" and Gladia experienced a sickening drop of two inches, Her knees bent under the impact in lopsided fashion and she fell against the wall."},{"id":554,"text":"She straightened with a little difficulty and was annoyed with herself for not having anticipated the change and been ready for it."},{"id":555,"text":"Daneel said unnecessarily, \"We have docked, Madam Gladia."},{"id":556,"text":"Partner Elijah asks permission to come aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Of course, Daneel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a whirring sound and a portion of the wall swirled into dilation."},{"id":557,"text":"A crouching figure moved through and the wall tightened and contracted behind it."},{"id":558,"text":"The figure straightened and Gladia whispered, \"Elijah!\" and felt overwhelmed with gladness and relief."},{"id":559,"text":"It seemed to her that his hair was grayer, but otherwise it was Elijah."},{"id":560,"text":"There was no other, noticeable change, no marked aging after all."},{"id":561,"text":"He smiled at her and, for a moment, seemed to devour her with his eyes."},{"id":562,"text":"Then he lifted one forefinger, as though to say, \"Wait,\" and walked toward Daneel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Daneel!\" He seized the robot's shoulders and shook him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You haven't changed."},{"id":563,"text":"Jehoshaphat!"},{"id":564,"text":"You're the constant in all our lives.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Partner Elijah."},{"id":565,"text":"It is good

the trip had been highly successful, so that perhaps his decision was the correct one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It was successful, Daneel."},{"id":573,"text":"Before the visit, the Earth government was reluctant to cooperate in the Settlement procedure, but now the whole planet -is pulsing and heaving and, by the million, people are anxious to go."},{"id":574,"text":"We don't have the ships to accommodate them all-even with Auroran help-and we don't have the worlds to receive them all, for every world must be adjusted."},{"id":575,"text":"Not one will accommodate a human community unchanged."},{"id":576,"text":"The one I'm going to is low in free oxygen and we're going to have to live in domed towns for a generation while Earth-type vegetation spreads over the planet. \" His eyes were turning more and more often to Gladia as she sat there smiling."},{"id":577,"text":"Daneel said, \"It is to be expected."},{"id":578,"text":"From what I have learned of human history, the Spacer worlds also went through a period of terraforming.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They certainly did!"},{"id":579,"text":"And thanks to that experience, the process can be carried through more rapidly now.

through the arched doorway that led into the pilot room and Baley looked at Gladia in a questioning way and made a sideways motion with his hand."},{"id":581,"text":"Understanding perfectly, she walked over and touched the contact that drew the partition noiselessly across the doorway."},{"id":582,"text":"They were, to all intents, alone."},{"id":583,"text":"Baley held out his hands. \"Gladia!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe took them in hers, never even thinking she was ungloved."},{"id":584,"text":"She said, \"Had Daneel stayed with us, he would not have hampered us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not physically."},{"id":585,"text":"He would have psychologically!\" Baley smiled sadly and said, \"Forgive me, Gladia."},{"id":586,"text":"I had to speak to Daneel first.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou've known him longer,\" she said softly. \"He takes precedence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't- but he has no defenses."},{"id":587,"text":"If you are annoyed with me, Gladia, you can punch me in the eye if you want to."},{"id":588,"text":"Daneel can't."},{"id":589,"text":"I can ignore him, order him away, treat him as though he were a robot, and he would be compelled to obey and be the same loyal and uncomplaining partner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The fact is that he is a robot, Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Never to me, Gladia."},{"id":590,"text":"My mind knows he is a robot and has no feelings in the human fashion, but my heart considers him human and I must treat him so."},{"id":591,"text":"I would ask Dr."},{"id":592,"text":"Fastolfe to let me take Daneel with me, but no robots are allowed on the new Settler worlds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Would you dream of taking me with you, Elijah?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No Spacers, either.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It seems you Earthmen are as unreasoningly exclusive

and I'd never be sure that your immune mechanisms would build up properly."},{"id":595,"text":"I'd be afraid that you would either die quickly of some minor infection or that you would live too long

thought of being in space and of not stopping at Aurora tore me apart."},{"id":599,"text":"And yet it does no good, Gladia."},{"id":600,"text":"It just means another leave-taking and that will tear me apart, too."},{"id":601,"text":"It is why I have never written you why I have never tried to reach you by hyperwave."},{"id":602,"text":"Surely you must have wondered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not really."},{"id":603,"text":"I agree with you that there was no point."},{"id":604,"text":"It would merely make it all infinitely harder."},{"id":605,"text":"Yet I wrote to, you many times.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You did?"},{"id":606,"text":"I never received one letter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I never mailed one letter."},{"id":607,"text":"Having written them, I destroyed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Because, Elijah, no private letter can be sent from Aurora to Earth without passing through the hands of the censor and I wrote you not one letter

been."},{"id":609,"text":"I thought that was why I never received a letter."},{"id":610,"text":"Now that I know you weren't aware of the situation, I am extraordinarily glad that you were not so foolish as, to try to remain in touch with me."},{"id":611,"text":"You would have misunderstood my never answering your letters.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaley stared at her. \"How is it I see you

ignorance that kept me safe."},{"id":619,"text":"Triple ignorance, for I didn't know the proper hyperwave combination to reach you directly and I couldn't face the difficulty of trying to find the combination on Earth."},{"id":620,"text":"I couldn't have done it privately and there was already sufficient comment all, over the Galaxy about you and me, thanks to that foolish hyperwave drama they put on the subwaves after Solaria."},{"id":621,"text":"Otherwise, I promise you, I would have tried."},{"id":622,"text":"I had Dr."},{"id":623,"text":"Fastolfe's combination, however, and once I was in orbit around Aurora, I contacted him at once.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In any case, we're here.\" She sat down on the side of her bunk and held out her hands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaley took them and tried to sit down on a stool, which he had hitched one foot over, but she drew him insistently toward the bunk and he sat down beside her."},{"id":624,"text":"He said awkwardly, \"How is it with you,

only that we might ask after each other's families?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaley's face grew solemn, almost anxious. \"I can't ask you-\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then I ask you."},{"id":652,"text":"This bunk is not really designed with sexual activity in mind, but you'll chance the possibility of falling out of it, I hope."},{"id":653,"text":"Baley said hesitantly, \"Gladia, I can't deny

folly of men, of Elijah approaching her with hesitation, with total unappreciation of his effect on her."},{"id":672,"text":"She was aware of his absence, for he had gone in to speak to Daneel, who was to be last as he was first."},{"id":673,"text":"Earthmen feared and hated robots and yet Elijah, knowing full well, that Daneel was a robot, treated him only as a person Spacers, on the other

detail."},{"id":783,"text":"Surely somewhere in the long tale of human events, there must be buried the Laws of Humanics that are equivalent to our Three Laws of Robotics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel

lacunae and backtracking that can turn memory into hours-long daydreaming."},{"id":789,"text":"It was robotic memory ticking off the events exactly as they had happened, but in vastly hastened fashion."},{"id":790,"text":"The seconds reeled off in nanoseconds, so that days of events could be relived with such rapid precision as to introduce no perceptible gap in a conversation."},{"id":791,"text":"As Giskard had done innumerable times before, he relived that visit to Earth, always seeking for understanding of Elijah Baley's casual ability to foresee the future,

delegation."},{"id":797,"text":"This Fastolfe shrugged off, since it seemed to him (as he later explained to Giskard) that he would be more welcome if he came alone."},{"id":798,"text":"A delegation

Giskard, however."},{"id":800,"text":"To have arrived without any robots would have been unthinkable, even for Fastolfe."},{"id":801,"text":"To have arrived with more than one would have put a strain

Earth and its people."},{"id":803,"text":"That was the rational excuse for the meeting."},{"id":804,"text":"The real excuse was simply that Fastolfe Wanted very much to see Baley again; he certainly owed him enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(That Giskard wanted to see Baley and that he very slightly tightened the emotion and impulse in Fastolfe's brain to bring that about, Fastolfe had no way of knowing-or even imagining.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaley was waiting for them at the time of landing and with him was a small group of Earth officials, so that there was a tedious passage of time during which politeness

under such circumstances is to ensure decay. \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You see those alternatives, then?"},{"id":866,"text":"Expansion and advancement?"},{"id":867,"text":"Nonexpansion and decay?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I believe so."},{"id":868,"text":"Therefore, if Earth refuses expansion, then Spacers must accept it."},{"id":869,"text":"Humanity, whether in the form of Earthpeople or Spacers, must expand."},{"id":870,"text":"I would like to see Earthpeople undertake the task, but, failing that, Spacer expansion is better than no expansion at all."},{"id":871,"text":"One alternative or the other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And if one expands but not the other?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then the expanding society will become steadily stronger and the nonexpanding one steadily weaker.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Are you certain of that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It would be unavoidable, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFastolfe nodded. \"Actually, I agree."},{"id":872,"text":"It is why I am trying to persuade both Earthpeople and Spacers to expand and advance."},{"id":873,"text":"That is a third alternative, and, I think, the best.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMemory flickered past the days that followed -incredible mobs of people moving ceaselessly past each other in streams and eddies-racing Expressways being mounted and dismounted -endless conferences with innumerable officials-minds in crowds."},{"id":874,"text":"Particularly minds in crowds."},{"id":875,"text":"Minds in crowds so thick that Giskard could not isolate individuals."},{"id":876,"text":"Mass minds mixing and melting together into a vast pulsating grayness with all that was detectable being the periodic sparks of suspicion and dislike that shot outward every time one of the multitude paused to look, at him."},{"id":877,"text":"Only when Fastolfe was in conference with a few officials could Giskard deal with the individual mind and that, of course, was when it counted."},{"id":878,"text":"Memory slowed at one point near the end of the stay on Earth, when Giskard could finally maneuver a time alone with Baley again."},{"id":879,"text":"Giskard adjusted a few minds minimally in order to make certain there would be no interruption for some time."},{"id":880,"text":"Baley said apologetically, \"I haven't really been ignoring you, Giskard."},{"id":881,"text":"I simply haven't had the opportunity to be alone with you."},{"id":882,"text":"I don't rate highly on Earth and I cannot order my comings and goings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have, of course, understood that, sir, but we will

told you the truth, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And you remember, I hope, my request when I last saw you on Aurora that you guard Gladia and protect her from harm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Friend Daneel and I, sir, are both mindful of your request."},{"id":888,"text":"I have arranged it so that when Dr."},{"id":889,"text":"Fastolfe is no longer alive, both friend Daneel and I will become part of Madam Gladia's establishment."},{"id":890,"text":"We will then be in an even better position to keep her from harm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Baley sadly, \"will be after my time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I understand that, sir, and regret it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it can't be helped and a crisis will come-or may come- even before that and yet still be after my time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What is it, sir, that you have in mind?"},{"id":891,"text":"What is this crisis?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Giskard, it is a crisis that may arise because Dr., Fastolfe is a surprisingly persuasive

Dr."},{"id":893,"text":"Fastolfe has seen and interviewed now seems to be enthusiastically in favor of emigration."},{"id":894,"text":"They were not in favor earlier or, if they were, it was with strong reservations."},{"id":895,"text":"And once the opinion making leaders are in favor, others are sure to follow."},{"id":896,"text":"This will spread like an epidemic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is this not what you wish, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is, but it is almost too much what I wish."},{"id":897,"text":"We shall spread out over the Galaxy-but what if the Spacers don't?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why should they not?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I don't know."},{"id":898,"text":"I advance it as a supposition, a possibility."},{"id":899,"text":"What if they don't?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Earth and the worlds its people settle will then grow stronger, according to what I have heard you say.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And the Spacers will grow weaker."},{"id":900,"text":"There will, however, be a period of time during which the Spacers will remain stronger than Earth and its Settlers, though by a steadily diminishing margin."},{"id":901,"text":"Eventually, the Spacers will inevitably become aware of Earthpeople as a growing danger."},{"id":902,"text":"At that time the Spacer worlds will surely decide that Earth and the Settlers must be stopped before it is too late and it will seem to them that drastic measures will have to be taken."},{"id":903,"text":"That will be a period of crisis that will determine the entire future history of human beings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I see your point, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaley remained in thoughtful silence for a moment, then said, in very nearly a whisper as though dreading being overheard, \"Who knows of your abilities?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Among human beings only yourself-and you cannot mention it to others.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I know well I can't."},{"id":904,"text":"The point is, though, that it is you, not Fastolfe, who has engineered the turnaround that has made every official with whom you've come in contact a proponent of emigration."},{"id":905,"text":"And it is to bring that about that you arranged to have Fastolfe take you, rather than Daneel, to Earth with him- you were essential and Daneel might have been a distraction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, I felt it necessary to keep personnel to a minimum in order to avoid making my task harder by abrading the sensitivities of Earthpeople."},{"id":906,"text":"I regret, sir, Daneel's absence."},{"id":907,"text":"I fully sense your disappointment at not being able to greet him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well---\", Baley shook his head."},{"id":908,"text":"I understand the necessity and I rely on your explaining to Daneel that I badly missed him."},{"id":909,"text":"In any case, I am still making my point."},{"id":910,"text":"If Earth embarks on a great policy of world settlement and if the Spacers are left behind in the race to expand, the responsibility for that-and therefore for the crisis that will inevitably arise-will be yours."},{"id":911,"text":"You must, for that reason, feel it your further responsibility to use your abilities to protect Earth when the crisis comes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I will do what I can, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And should you succeed there, Amadiro-or his followers -may turn on Gladia."},{"id":912,"text":"You must not forget to protect her, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Daneel and I will not forget.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Giskard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd they parted."},{"id":913,"text":"When Giskard, following Fastolfe, entered the module to begin the voyage back to Aurora, he saw Baley once again."},{"id":914,"text":"This time there was no opportunity to speak to him."},{"id":915,"text":"Baley waved and mouthed one soundless word: \"Remember."},{"id":916,"text":"Giskard sensed the word and, in addition, the emotion behind it."},{"id":917,"text":"After that, Giskard never saw Baley again."},{"id":918,"text":"Never."},{"id":919,"text":"Giskard had never found it possible to flip through the sharp images of that one visit to Earth, without then following it with the images of the key visit to Amadiro at the Institute of Robotics."},{"id":920,"text":"It had not been an easy conference to arrange."},{"id":921,"text":"Amadiro, with the bitterness of defeat heavy upon him, would not exacerbate his humiliation by going to Fastolfe's establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" Fastolfe had said to Giskard. \"I can afford to be magnanimous in victory."},{"id":922,"text":"I will go to him."},{"id":923,"text":"Besides, I must see him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFastolfe had been a member of the Institute of Robotics since Baley had made possible the crushing of Amadiro and of his political ambitions."},{"id":924,"text":"In return, Fastolfe had passed over to the Institute all the data for the building and, maintenance of humaniform robots."},{"id":925,"text":"A number had been manufactured and then the project had come to an, end and Fastolfe had chafed."},{"id":926,"text":"It had been Fastolfe's intention, at first, to arrive at the Institute without any robot companion."},{"id":927,"text":"He would have placed himself, without protection and (so to speak) naked, into the midst of what was still the stronghold of the enemy's camp."},{"id":928,"text":"It would have been a sign of humility and trust, but it would also have been an indication of complete selfconfidence and Amadiro would have understood that."},{"id":929,"text":"Fastolfe, entirely alone, would be demonstrating his certainty that Amadiro, with all the resources of the Institute at his command, would not dare to touch his single enemy coming carelessly and defenselessly within reach of his fist."},{"id":930,"text":"And yet in the end, Fastolfe, not quite knowing how, chose to have Giskard accompany him."},{"id":931,"text":"Amadiro seemed to have lost a little weight since last Fastolfe had seen him, but he was still a formidable specimen; tall and heavyset."},{"id":932,"text":"He lacked the self-confident smile that had once been his hallmark and when he attempted it at Fastolfe's entrance, it seemed more like a snarl that faded into a look of somber dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, Kelden,\" said Fastolfe, making free with the other's familiar name, \"we don't see each other often, despite the fact that we have now been colleagues for four years.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Let's not have any false bonhomie, Fastolfe,\" said Amadiro in a clearly annoyed and low-pitched growl, \"and address me as Amadiro."},{"id":933,"text":"We are not colleagues except in name and I make no secret-and never have-of my belief that your foreign policy is suicidal for us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThree of Amadiro's robots, large and gleaming, were present and Fastolfe studied them with raised eyebrows, \"You are well protected, Amadiro, against one man of peace together with his single robot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They will not attack you, Fastolfe, as you well know."},{"id":934,"text":"But why did you bring Giskard?"},{"id":935,"text":"Why not your masterpiece, Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Would it be safe to bring Daneel within your reach, Amadiro?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I take it you intend that as humor."},{"id":936,"text":"I no longer need Daneel."},{"id":937,"text":"We build our own humaniforms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On the basis of my design.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With improvements.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And yet you do not use the humaniforms."},{"id":938,"text":"That is why I have come to see you."},{"id":939,"text":"I know that my position in the Institute is a name-only thing and that even my presence is unwelcome, let alone my opinions and recommendations."},{"id":940,"text":"However, I must, as an Institute member, protest your failure to use the humaniforms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How do you wish me to use them?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The intention was to have the humaniforms open up new worlds into which Spacers could eventually emigrate, after those worlds had been terraformed and made completely habitable, wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But that was something you opposed, Fastolfe, wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFastolfe said, \"Yes, I did."},{"id":941,"text":"I wanted Spacers themselves to emigrate, to new worlds and to do their own terraforming."},{"id":942,"text":"That, however, is not happening and, I now see, is not likely to happen."},{"id":943,"text":"Let us send the humaniforms, then."},{"id":944,"text":"That would be better than nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All our alternatives come to nothing, as long as your views dominate the Council, Fastolfe."},{"id":945,"text":"Spacers will not travel to rude and unformed worlds; nor, it seems, do- they like humaniform robots.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You have scarcely given the Spacers a chance to like them."},{"id":946,"text":"Earthpeople are beginning to settle new planet seven rude and unformed ones."},{"id":947,"text":"And."},{"id":948,"text":"they do it without robotic help.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know very well the differences between Earthpeople and ourselves."},{"id":949,"text":"There are eight billion Earthpeople, plus a large number of Settlers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And there are five and a half billion Spacers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Numbers are not the sole difference,\" said Amadiro bitterly. \"They breed like insects.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They do not."},{"id":950,"text":"Earth's population has been fairly stable for centuries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The potential is there."},{"id":951,"text":"If they put all their heart into emigration, they can easily produce one hundred and sixty million new bodies each year and that number will rise as the new worlds fill UP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We have the biological capability of producing one hundred million new bodies each year.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But not the sociological capability."},{"id":952,"text":"We are long-lived, we do not wish ourselves replaced so quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We can send a large portion of the new bodies to other worlds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They won't go."},{"id":953,"text":"We value our bodies, which are strong, healthy, and capable of surviving in strength and health for nearly forty decades."},{"id":954,"text":"Earthmen can place no value on bodies that wear out in less than ten decades and that are riddled with disease and degeneration even over that short period of time."},{"id":955,"text":"It doesn't matter to them if they send out millions a year to certain misery and probable death."},{"id":956,"text":"In fact, even the victims needn't, fear misery and death, for what else do they have on, Earth?"},{"id":957,"text":"The Earthpeople who emigrate are fleeing from their pestilential world knowing well that any change can scarcely be for the worse."},{"id":958,"text":"We, on the other hand, value our well-wrought and comfortable planets and would not lightly give them up.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFastolfe sighed and said, \"I've heard all these arguments so often-May I point out the simple fact, Amadiro, that Aurora was originally a rude and unformed world that had to be terraformed into acceptability and that so was every Spacer world?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro said, \"And I have heard all your arguments to the point of nausea, but I will not weary of answering them."},{"id":959,"text":"Aurora may have been primitive when first settled, but Aurora was settled by Earthpeople-and other Spacer worlds, when, not settled by Earthpeople, were settled by Spacers that had not yet outgrown their Earth heritage, The times are no longer suitable for that."},{"id":960,"text":"What could be done then, cannot be done now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro lifted a comer of his mouth in a snarl and went on, \"No, Fastolfe, what your policy has accomplished has been to begin the creation of a Galaxy that will be populated by Earthmen only, while Spacers must wither and decline."},{"id":961,"text":"You can see it happening now."},{"id":962,"text":"Your famous trip to Earth, two years ago, was the turning point."},{"id":963,"text":"Somehow, you betrayed your own people by encouraging those half-humans to begin an expansion."},{"id":964,"text":"In only two years there are at least some Earthpeople on each of twenty-four worlds and new ones are being added steadily.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFastolfe said, \"Do not exaggerate."},{"id":965,"text":"Not one of those Settler worlds is truly fit for human occupation yet and won't be for some decades."},{"id":966,"text":"Not all are likely to survive and, as the nearer worlds are occupied, the chances for settling farther worlds diminish so that the initial surge will slow down."},{"id":967,"text":"I encouraged their expansion because I counted on ours as well."},{"id":968,"text":"We can still keep up with them if we make the effort and, in healthy competition, we can fill the Galaxy together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Amadiro. \"What you have in mind is that most destructive of all policies, a foolish idealism."},{"id":969,"text":"The expansion is one-sided and will remain so despite anything you can do."},{"id":970,"text":"The people of Earth swarm unhindered and they will have to be stopped before they get too strong to stop.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How do you propose to do that?"},{"id":971,"text":"We have a treaty of friendship with Earth in which we specifically agree not to stop their expansion into space as long as no planet within twenty light-years of a Spacer world is touched."},{"id":972,"text":"They have adhered to this scrupulously.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro said, \"Everyone knows about the treaty."},{"id":973,"text":"Everyone also knows that no treaty has ever been kept once it begins to work against the national interests of the more powerful signatory."},{"id":974,"text":"I attach no value to that treaty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do."},{"id":975,"text":"It will be held to.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro shook his head. \"You have touching faith."},{"id":976,"text":"How will it be held to after you are out of power?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I don't intend to be out of power for a while.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As Earth and its Settlers grow stronger, the Spacers will grow fearful and, you will not remain long in power after that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFastolfe said, \"And if you tear up the treaty and destroy the Settler worlds and slam the gates shut on Earth, will the Spacers then emigrate and fill the Galaxy?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not."},{"id":977,"text":"But if we decide not to, if we decide we are comfortable as we are, what difference will that make?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Galaxy will not, in that case, become a human empire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd if it does not, what then?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then the Spacers will stultify and degenerate, even if Earth is kept in prison and also stultifies and degenerates.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That is just the claptrap your party puts out, Fastolfe."},{"id":978,"text":"There is no actual evidence that such a thing would happen."},{"id":979,"text":"And even if it does, that will be our choice."},{"id":980,"text":"At least we will not see the barbarian short-lifers fall heir to the Galaxy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFastolfe said, \"Are you seriously suggesting, Amadiro, that you would be willing to see the Spacer civilization die, provided you can prevent Earth from expanding?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'm not counting on our death, Fastolfe, but if the worst happens, why, yes, to me our own death is a less fearful thing than the triumph of a subhuman disease-riddled set of short-lived beings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"From whom we are descended.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And with whom we are no longer truly related genetically."},{"id":981,"text":"Are we worms because a billion years ago, worms were among our, ancestors?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFastolfe, lips pressed together, rose to go."},{"id":982,"text":"Amadiro, glowering, made no move to stop him."},{"id":983,"text":"Daneel had no way of telling, directly, that Giskard was lost in memory."},{"id":984,"text":"For one thing, Giskard's expression did not change and for another, he was not lost in memory as humans might be."},{"id":985,"text":"It took no substantial period of time."},{"id":986,"text":"On the other hand, the line of thought that had caused Giskard to think of the past had caused Daneel to think of the same events, of that past as they had long ago been recounted to him by Giskard."},{"id":987,"text":"Nor was Giskard surprised at that."},{"id":988,"text":"Their conversation carried on with no unusual pause, but in a markedly new manner, as though each had thought of the past on behalf of both."},{"id":989,"text":"Daneel said, \"It might seem, friend Giskard, that since the people of Aurora now recognize that they are weaker than Earth and its many Settler worlds, the crisis that Elijah Baley foresaw has been safely passed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It might seem so, friend, Daneel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You labored to bring that about.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I did."},{"id":990,"text":"I kept the Council in Fastolfe's

stage of the process, although I endeavored to do no harm to anyone."},{"id":993,"text":"I have touched- mentally- not one human being who required anything more than the lightest touch."},{"id":994,"text":"On Earth, I had merely to lighten the fear of reprisal and chose those, particularly, in which the fear was already light and broke a thread that was, in any case, frayed and on the point of breaking."},{"id":995,"text":"On Aurora, it was reversed."},{"id":996,"text":"The policy makers here were reluctant to espouse policies that would lead to an exit from their comfortable world and I merely confirmed that and made the sturdy cord that held them a bit stronger."},{"id":997,"text":"And doing this has immersed me in a constant-if faint turmoil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why?"},{"id":998,"text":"You encouraged the expansion of Earth and discouraged the expansion of the Spacers."},{"id":999,"text":"Surely that is as it should be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As it should be?"},{"id":1000,"text":"Do you think, friend Daneel, that an Earthperson counts for more than a Spacer, even though both are human beings?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There are differences."},{"id":1001,"text":"Elijah Baley would rather see his own Earthpeople defeated than see the Galaxy uninhabited."},{"id":1002,"text":"Dr."},{"id":1003,"text":"Amadiro would rather see both Earth and Spacers dwindle than see Earth expand."},{"id":1004,"text":"The first looks with hope to the triumph of either, the second is content to see the triumph of neither."},{"id":1005,"text":"Should we not choose the first, friend Giskard?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, friend Daneel."},{"id":1006,"text":"So it would seem."},{"id":1007,"text":"And yet how far are you influenced by your feeling of the special worth of your onetime partner, Elijah Baley?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"I value the memory of Partner Elijah and, the people of Earth are his people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I see you do."},{"id":1008,"text":"I have been saying for many decades that you tend to think like a human being, friend Daneel, but I wonder if that is necessarily, a compliment."},{"id":1009,"text":"Still, though you tend to think like a human being, you are not a human being and, in the end, you are bound to the Three Laws."},{"id":1010,"text":"You may not harm a human being, whether that human being is an Earthman or a Spacer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There are times, friend Giskard, when one must choose one human being over another."},{"id":1011,"text":"We have been given special orders to protect Lady Gladia."},{"id":1012,"text":"I would be forced, on occasion, to harm a human being in order to protect Lady Gladia and I think that, all things being equal, I would be willing to harm a Spacer just a little in order to protect an Earthperson.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So you think."},{"id":1013,"text":"But in the actual event, you would have to be guided by specific circumstances."},{"id":1014,"text":"You will find you cannot generalize,\" said Giskard. \"And so it is with me."},{"id":1015,"text":"In encouraging Earth and discouraging Aurora, I have made

not help but realize that that portion of his labors was brought to nothing."},{"id":1018,"text":"This was bound to fill him with gathering despair and perhaps it hastened his

once."},{"id":1068,"text":"Indeed, it seemed scarcely something that required a personal visit."},{"id":1069,"text":"It might have been handled by holographic image by any official of the Council."},{"id":1070,"text":"On the other hand, Dr."},{"id":1071,"text":"Mandamus dealt with the matter of his own descent first, discussed it in great detail, and it was a matter that could have been handled only by him and by no one else.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What is your conclusion, friend Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I believe that the matter of the Settler was seized upon by Dr."},{"id":1072,"text":"Mandamus as an excuse for a personal conversation with Madam Gladia, in order that he might discuss his descent in privacy."},{"id":1073,"text":"It was the matter of his descent and nothing else that truly interested him. -Is there any way you can support that conclusion, friend Giskard?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAurora's sun had not yet emerged from the clouds and the faint glow of Giskard's eyes was visible."},{"id":1074,"text":"He said, \"The tension in Dr."},{"id":1075,"text":"Mandamus's mind was indeed measurably stronger in the first part of the interview than in the second."},{"id":1076,"text":"That may serve as corroboration, perhaps, friend Daneel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Then we must ask ourselves why the question of

only by demonstrating that he is not descended from Elijah Baley that his road to advancement is open."},{"id":1080,"text":"Dr."},{"id":1081,"text":"Amadiro, upon whose goodwill he is dependent, would turn against him absolutely if he were a descendant of Mr."},{"id":1082,"text":"Baley.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So he said, friend Giskard, but what took place during the interview argues against that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why do you say so?"},{"id":1083,"text":"Please continue thinking like a human being, friend Daneel."},{"id":1084,"text":"I find it instructive.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said gravely, \"Thank you, friend Giskard."},{"id":1085,"text":"Did you note that not one statement that Madam Gladia made concerning the impossibility of Dr."},{"id":1086,"text":"Mandamus's descent from Partner Elijah was considered convincing?"},{"id":1087,"text":"In every case, Dr."},{"id":1088,"text":"Mandamus said that Dr."},{"id":1089,"text":"Amadiro would not accept the statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes and what do you deduce from that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that Dr."},{"id":1090,"text":"Mandamus was so convinced that Dr."},{"id":1091,"text":"Amadiro would accept no argument against Elijah Baley an ancestor that one must wonder why he should have bothered to ask Madam Gladia about the matter."},{"id":1092,"text":"He apparently knew from the start that it would be pointless to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, friend Daneel, but it is mere speculation."},{"id":1093,"text":"Can you supply a possible motive for his action, then?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I can."},{"id":1094,"text":"I believe he inquired as to his descent, not to convince an implacable Dr."},{"id":1095,"text":"Amadiro but to convince himself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that case, why should he have mentioned Dr."},{"id":1096,"text":"Amadiro at all?"},{"id":1097,"text":"Why not simply have said, \"I wish to know.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA small smile passed over Daneel's face, a change of expression of which the other robot would have been incapable."},{"id":1098,"text":"Daneel said, \"Had he said, 'I wish to know,' to Madam Gladia, she would surely have replied that it was none of his business and he would have discovered nothing."},{"id":1099,"text":"Madam Gladia, however, is as strongly opposed to Dr."},{"id":1100,"text":"Amadiro as Dr."},{"id":1101,"text":"Amadiro is to Elijah Baley."},{"id":1102,"text":"Madam Gladia would be sure to take offense at any opinion strongly held by Dr."},{"id":1103,"text":"Amadiro concerning her."},{"id":1104,"text":"She would be furious, even if the opinion were more or less true; how much more, then, if it were absolutely false, as in this case."},{"id":1105,"text":"She would labor to demonstrate Dr."},{"id":1106,"text":"Amadiro to be wrong and would present every piece of evidence needed to achieve that end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In such a case, Dr."},{"id":1107,"text":"Mandamus's cold assurance that each piece of evidence was insufficient would but make her the angrier and would drive her to further revelations."},{"id":1108,"text":"Dr."},{"id":1109,"text":"Mandamus's strategy was chosen to make certain he would learn the maximum from Madam Gladia and, at the end, he was convinced that he did not have an Earthman as ancestor; at least, not as recently as twenty decades ago."},{"id":1110,"text":"Amadiro's feelings in this regard were not, I think, truly in question.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"Friend Daneel, this is an interesting point of view, but it does not seem to be strongly founded."},{"id":1111,"text":"In what way can we conclude that it is no more than a guess on your part?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Does it not seem to you, friend Giskard, that when Dr."},{"id":1112,"text":"Mandamus ended his inquiry into his descent without having obtained sufficient evidence for Dr."},{"id":1113,"text":"Amadiro, as he would have had us believe, that he should have been distinctly depressed and disheartened."},{"id":1114,"text":"By his own statement, this should have meant he had no chance for advancement and would never gain the position as head of the Institute of Robotics."},{"id":1115,"text":"And yet it seemed to me that he was far from depressed but was, indeed, jubilant."},{"id":1116,"text":"I can only judge by outward appearance, but you can do better."},{"id":1117,"text":"Tell me, friend Giskard, what was his mental attitude at the conclusion of this portion of his conversation with Madam Gladia?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"As I look back on it, it was not only jubilant but triumphant, friend Daneel."},{"id":1118,"text":"You are right."},{"id":1119,"text":"Now that you have explained your process of thought, that sensation of triumph I detected clearly marks the accuracy of your reasoning."},{"id":1120,"text":"In fact, now that you have marked it all out, I find myself at a loss to account for my inability to see it for myself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That, friend Giskard, was, on a number of occasions, my reaction to the reasoning of Elijah Baley."},{"id":1121,"text":"That I could carry through such reasoning on this occasion may be, in part, because of the strong stimulus of the existence of the present crisis."},{"id":1122,"text":"It forces me to think more cogently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You underestimate yourself, friend Daneel."},{"id":1123,"text":"You have been thinking cogently for a long time."},{"id":1124,"text":"But why do you speak of a present crisis?"},{"id":1125,"text":"Pause a moment and explain."},{"id":1126,"text":"How does one go from Dr."},{"id":1127,"text":"Mandamus's feeling of triumph at not being descended from Mr."},{"id":1128,"text":"Baley to this crisis you speak of?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Dr."},{"id":1129,"text":"Mandamus may have deceived us with his statements concerning Dr."},{"id":1130,"text":"Amadiro, but it may be fair to suppose that it is nevertheless true that he longs for advancement; that he is ambitious to become head of the Institute."},{"id":1131,"text":"Is that not so, friend Giskard?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard paused a moment, as though in thought, then said, \"I was not searching for ambition."},{"id":1132,"text":"I was studying his mind without particular purpose and was aware of only surface manifestations."},{"id":1133,"text":"Yet there might have been flashes of ambition there when he spoke of advancement."},{"id":1134,"text":"I do not have strong grounds for agreeing with you, friend Daneel, but I have no grounds at all for disagreeing with you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Let us accept Dr."},{"id":1135,"text":"Mandamus as an ambitious man, then, and see where that takes us."},{"id":1136,"text":"Agreed?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Agreed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then does it not seem likely that his sense of triumph, once he was convinced that he was not descended from Partner Elijah, arose from the fact that he felt his ambition could now be served."},{"id":1137,"text":"This would not be so, however, because of Dr."},{"id":1138,"text":"Amadiro's approval, since we have agreed that the Dr."},{"id":1139,"text":"Amadiro motif was introduced by Dr."},{"id":1140,"text":"Mandamus as a distraction."},{"id":1141,"text":"His ambition could now be served for some other reason.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What other reason?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There, is none that arises out of compelling evidence."},{"id":1142,"text":"But I can suggest one as a matter of speculation."},{"id":1143,"text":"What if Dr."},{"id":1144,"text":"Mandamus knows something or can do something that would lead to some huge success; one that would surely make him the next head?"},{"id":1145,"text":"Remember that at the conclusion of the search into the manner of his descent, Dr."},{"id":1146,"text":"Mandamus said, \"There are powerful methods remaining to me."},{"id":1147,"text":"Suppose that is true, but that he could only use those methods if he were not descended from Partner Elijah."},{"id":1148,"text":"His jubilation over having been convinced of his nondescent would arise, then, from the fact that he could now use those methods and assure himself of great advancement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But what are these powerful methods, friend Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said gravely, \"We must continue to speculate."},{"id":1149,"text":"We know that Dr."},{"id":1150,"text":"Amadiro wants nothing so much as to defeat Earth and force it back to its earlier position of subservience to the Spacer worlds."},{"id":1151,"text":"If Dr."},{"id":1152,"text":"Mandamus has a way of doing this, he can surely get anything he wants out of Dr."},{"id":1153,"text":"Amadiro, up to and including a guarantee of, succession to the headship."},{"id":1154,"text":"Yet it may be that Dr."},{"id":1155,"text":"Mandamus hesitates to bring about Earth's defeat and humiliation unless he felt no kinship to its people."},{"id":1156,"text":"Descent from Elijah Baley of Earth would inhibit him."},{"id":1157,"text":"The denial of that descent frees him to act and that makes him jubilant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"You mean Dr."},{"id":1158,"text":"Mandamus is a man of conscience?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Conscience?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is a word human beings sometimes use."},{"id":1159,"text":"I have gathered that it is applied to a person who adheres to rules of behavior that force him to act in ways that oppose his immediate self-interest."},{"id":1160,"text":"If Dr."},{"id":1161,"text":"Mandamus feels that he cannot allow himself to advance at the expense of those with whom he is distantly connected, I imagine him to be a man of conscience."},{"id":1162,"text":"I have thought much of such things, friend Daneel, since they seem to imply that human beings do have Laws governing their behavior, at least in some cases.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And can you tell whether Dr."},{"id":1163,"text":"Mandamus is, indeed, a man of conscience?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"From my observations of his emotions?"},{"id":1164,"text":"No, I was not watching for anything like that, but if your analysis is correct, conscience would seem to follow. -And yet, on the other hand, if we begin by supposing him a man of conscience and argue backward, we can come to other conclusions."},{"id":1165,"text":"It might seem that if Dr."},{"id":1166,"text":"Mandamus thought he had an Earthman in his ancestry a mere nineteen and a half decades ago, he might feel driven, against his conscience, to spearhead an attempt to defeat Earth as a way of freeing himself from the stigma of such descent."},{"id":1167,"text":"If he were not so descended, then he would not be unbearably driven to act against Earth and his conscience would be free to cause him to leave Earth alone.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"No, friend Giskard."},{"id":1168,"text":"That would not fit the facts."},{"id":1169,"text":"However relieved he might be at not having to take violent action against Earth, he would be left without a way of satisfying Dr."},{"id":1170,"text":"Amadiro and enforcing his own advance Considering his ambitious nature, he would not be left with the feeling of triumph you so clearly noted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I see."},{"id":1171,"text":"Then we conclude that Dr."},{"id":1172,"text":"Mandamus has a method for defeating Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes."},{"id":1173,"text":"And if that is so, then the crisis foreseen by Partner Elijah has not been safely passed after all, but is now here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said thoughtfully, \"But we are left with the key question unanswered, friend Daneel."},{"id":1174,"text":"What is the nature of the crisis?"},{"id":1175,"text":"What is the deadly danger?"},{"id":1176,"text":"Can you deduce that, too?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That I cannot do,

once I lived with Dr."},{"id":1183,"text":"Fastolfe, as now I live with Madam Gladia, I could, little by little, unfold the layers of mind, one leaf after another, untie the intricate knot a bit at a time, and learn a great deal without harming him or her."},{"id":1184,"text":"To do the same to Dr."},{"id":1185,"text":"Mandamus after one brief meeting or after a hundred brief meetings, would accomplish little."},{"id":1186,"text":"Emotions are readily apparent, thoughts are not."},{"id":1187,"text":"If, out of a sense of urgency, I attempted to make haste, forcing the process, I would

then.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If Dr."},{"id":1200,"text":"Mandamus is to be restrained, it can be done by damaging his mind to the point where it is no longer effective-or by destroying his life outright."},{"id":1201,"text":"I alone possess the ability to injure his mind appropriately, but I cannot do this."},{"id":1202,"text":"However, either one of us can physically bring his life to an end."},{"id":1203,"text":"I cannot do this, either."},{"id":1204,"text":"Can you do it, friend Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a pause and Daneel finally whispered. \"I

death."},{"id":1209,"text":"She had opacified all the windows in her bedroom, adjusted the environment to a gentle warm breeze with the faint sound of rustling leaves and the occasional soft warble of

we can go is for us to arrange for Madam Gladia to go."},{"id":1652,"text":"As for influencing her, that required scarcely a touch."},{"id":1653,"text":"Despite her loud statements to the contrary, she was eager to go."},{"id":1654,"text":"There was an overwhelming desire within her to see Solaria."},{"id":1655,"text":"It was a pain within her that would not cease until she went.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Since you say so, it is so, yet I find it puzzling."},{"id":1656,"text":"Had she not frequently made it plain that her life on Solaria was unhappy, that she had completely adopted Aurora and never wished to go back to her original home?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that was there, too."},{"id":1657,"text":"It was quite plainly in her mind."},{"id":1658,"text":"Both emotions, both feelings, existed together and simultaneously."},{"id":1659,"text":"I have observed something of this sort in human minds frequently; two opposite emotions simultaneously, present.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Such a condition does not seem logical, friend Giskard."},{"id":1660,"text":"I agree and I can only conclude that human beings are not, at all times or in all respects, logical."},{"id":1661,"text":"That must be one reason that it is so difficult to work out the Laws governing human behavior. -In Madam Gladia's case, I have now and then been aware of this longing for Solaria."},{"id":1662,"text":"Ordinarily, it was well hidden, obscured by the far more intense antipathy she also felt for the world."},{"id":1663,"text":"When the news arrived that Solaria had been abandoned by its people, however, her feelings changed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why so?"},{"id":1664,"text":"What had the abandonment to do with the youthful experiences that led Madam Gladia to her antipathy?"},{"id":1665,"text":"Or, having held in restraint her longing for the, world the decades when it was a working society, why she lose that restraint once it became an abandoned planet and newly long for a world which must now be something utterly strange to her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot explain, friend Daneel, since the more knowledge I gather of the human mind, the more despair I feel at being unable to understand it."},{"id":1666,"text":"It is not an unalloyed advantage to see into that mind and I often envy you the simplicity of behavior control that results from your inability to see below the surface.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel persisted. \"Have you guessed an explanation, friend Giskard?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I suppose she feels a sorrow for the empty planet."},{"id":1667,"text":"She deserted it twenty decades ago----\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"She was driven out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It seems to her, now, to have been a desertion and I imagine she plays with the painful thought that she had set an example; that if she had not left, no one else would have and the planet would still be populated and happy."},{"id":1668,"text":"Since I cannot read her thoughts, I am only groping backward, perhaps inaccurately, from her emotions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But she could not have set an example, friend Giskard."},{"id":1669,"text":"Since it is twenty decades since she left, there can be no verifiable causal connection between the much earlier event and the much later one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I agree, but human beings sometimes find a kind of pleasure in nursing painful- emotions, in blaming themselves without reason or even against reason. -In any case, Madam Gladia felt so sharply the longing to return that I felt it was necessary to release the inhibitory effect that kept her from agreeing to go."},{"id":1670,"text":"It required the merest touch."},{"id":1671,"text":"Yet though I feel it necessary for her to go, since that means she will take us there, I have the uneasy feeling, that the disadvantages might, just possibly, be greater than the advantages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In what way, friend Giskard?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Since the Council was eager to have Madam Gladia accompany the Settler, it may have been for the purpose of having Madam Gladia absent from Aurora during a crucial period when the defeat of Earth and its, Settler worlds is being prepared.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel seemed to be considering that statement."},{"id":1672,"text":"At least it was only after a distinct pause that he said, \"What purpose would be served, in your opinion, in having Madam Gladia absent?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cannot decide that, friend Daneel."},{"id":1673,"text":"I want your opinion. \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have not considered this matter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Consider it now!\" If Giskard had been human, the remark would have been an order."},{"id":1674,"text":"There was an even longer pause and then Daneel said, \"Friend Giskard, until the moment that Dr."},{"id":1675,"text":"Mandamus appeared in Madam Gladia's establishment, she had never shown any concern about international affairs."},{"id":1676,"text":"She was a friend of Dr."},{"id":1677,"text":"Fastolfe and of Elijah Baley, but this friendship was one of personal affection and did not have an ideological basis."},{"id":1678,"text":"Both of them, moreover, are now gone from us."},{"id":1679,"text":"She has an antipathy toward Dr."},{"id":1680,"text":"Amadiro and that is returned, but this is also a personal matter."},{"id":1681,"text":"The antipathy is two centuries old and neither has done anything material about it but have merely each remained stubbornly antipathetic."},{"id":1682,"text":"There can be no reason for Dr."},{"id":1683,"text":"Amadiro-who is now the dominant influence in the Council-to fear Madam Gladia or to go to the trouble of removing her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"You overlook the fact, that in removing Madam Gladia, he also removes you and me."},{"id":1684,"text":"He would, perhaps, feel quite certain Madam Gladia would not leave without us, so can it be us he, considers dangerous?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In the course of our existence, friend Giskard, we have never, in any way, given any appearance of having endangered Dr."},{"id":1685,"text":"Amadiro."},{"id":1686,"text":"What cause has he to fear us?"},{"id":1687,"text":"He does not know of your abilities or of how you have made use of them."},{"id":1688,"text":"Why, then, should he take the trouble to remove us, temporarily, from Aurora?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Temporarily, friend Daneel?"},{"id":1689,"text":"Why do you assume it is a temporary removal he plans?"},{"id":1690,"text":"He knows, it may be, more than the Settler does of the trouble on Solaria and knows, also, that the Settler and his crew will be surely destroyed and Madam Gladia and you and I with- them."},{"id":1691,"text":"Perhaps the destruction of the Settler's ship is his main aim, but he would consider the end of Dr."},{"id":1692,"text":"Fastolfe's friend and Dr."},{"id":1693,"text":"Fastolfe's robots to be an added bonus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Surely he would not risk war with the Settler worlds, for that may well come if the Settler's ship is destroyed and the minute pleasure of having us destroyed, when added in, would not make the risk worthwhile.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is it not possible, friend Daneel, that war is exactly, what Dr."},{"id":1694,"text":"Amadiro has in mind; that it involves no risk in his estimation, so, that getting rid of us at the same time adds to his pleasure without increasing a risk that does not exist?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said calmly, \"Friend Giskard, that is not reasonable."},{"id":1695,"text":"In any war fought under present conditions, the Settlers would win."},{"id":1696,"text":"They are better suited, psychologically, to the rigors of war."},{"id":1697,"text":"They are more scattered and can, therefore, more successfully carry on hit-and-run tactics."},{"id":1698,"text":"They have comparatively little to lose in their relatively primitive worlds, while the Spacers have much to lose in their comfortable, highly organized ones."},{"id":1699,"text":"If the Settlers were willing to offer to exchange destruction of one of their worlds for one of the Spacers, the Spacers would have to surrender, at once.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But would such a war be fought under present conditions?"},{"id":1700,"text":"What if the Spacers had a new weapon that could be used to defeat the Settlers quickly?"},{"id":1701,"text":"Might that not be the very crisis we are now facing?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In that case, friend Giskard, the victory could be better and more effectively gained in a surprise attack."},{"id":1702,"text":"Why go to the trouble of instigating a war, which the Settlers might begin by a surprise raid on Spacer worlds that would do considerable damage?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the Spacers need to test the weapon and the destruction of a series of ships on Solaria represents the testing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Spacers would have been most uningenious if they could not have found a method of testing that would not give away the new weapon s existence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now Giskard's turn, to consider. \"Very well, then friend Daneel, how would you explain this trip we are on?"},{"id":1703,"text":"How would you explain the Council's willingness -even eagerness-to have us accompany the Settler?"},{"id":1704,"text":"The Settler said they would order Gladia to go and, in effect, they did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have not considered the matter, friend Giskard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then consider it now.\" -Again it had the flavor of an order."},{"id":1705,"text":"Daneel said, \"I will do so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was silence, one that grew protracted, but Giskard by no word or sign showed any impatience as he waited."},{"id":1706,"text":"Finally, Daneel said-slowly, as though he were feeling his way along strange avenues of thought- I do not think that Baleyworld-or any of the Settler worlds-has a clear right to appropriate robotic property on Solaria."},{"id":1707,"text":"Even though the Solarians have themselves left or have, perhaps, died out, Solaria remains a Spacer world, even if an unoccupied one - Certainly, the remaining forty-nine Spacer worlds would reason so."},{"id":1708,"text":"Most of all, Aurora would reason so-if it felt in command of the situation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard considered that. \"Are you now saying, friend Daneel, that the destruction of the two Settler ships was the Spacer way of enforcing their proprietorship of Solaria?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"No, that would not be the way if Aurora, the leading Spacer power, felt in command of the situation."},{"id":1709,"text":"Aurora would then simply have announced that Solaria, empty or not, was off-limits to Settler vessels and would have threatened reprisals against the home worlds if any Settler vessel entered the Solarian planetary system."},{"id":1710,"text":"And they would have established a cordon of ships and sensory stations about that planetary system."},{"id":1711,"text":"There was no such warning, no such action, friend Giskard."},{"id":1712,"text":"Why, then, destroy ships that might have been kept away from the world quite easily in the first place?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But the ships were destroyed, friend Daneel."},{"id":1713,"text":"Will you make use of the basic illogicality of the human mind as an explanation?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not unless I have to."},{"id":1714,"text":"Let us for the moment take that destruction simply as given."},{"id":1715,"text":"Now consider the consequence-The captain of a single Settler vessel approaches Aurora, demands permission to discuss the situation with the Council, insists on taking an Auroran citizen with him to investigate events on Solaria, -and the Council gives in to everything."},{"id":1716,"text":"If destroying the ships without prior warning is too strong an action for Aurora, giving in to the Settler captain so cravenly is far too weak an action."},{"id":1717,"text":"Far from seeking a war, Aurora, in giving in, seems to be willing to do anything at all to ward off the possibility of war.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Giskard, \"I see that this is a possible way of interpreting events."},{"id":1718,"text":"But what follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said Daneel, \"that the Spacer worlds are not yet so weak that they must, behave with such servility-and, even if they were, the pride of centuries of overlordship would keep them from doing so."},{"id":1719,"text":"It must t* something other than weakness that is driving them."},{"id":1720,"text":"I have pointed out that they cannot be deliberately instigating a war, so it is much more likely that they are playing for time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To what end, friend Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They want to destroy the Settlers, but they are not yet prepared."},{"id":1721,"text":"They let this Settler have what he wants, to avoid a war until they are ready to, fight one on their own terms."},{"id":1722,"text":"I am only surprised that they did not offer to send an Auroran warship with him."},{"id":1723,"text":"If this analysis is correct-and I think it is-Aurora cannot possibly have had anything to do with the incidents on Solaria."},{"id":1724,"text":"They would not indulge in pinpricks, that could only serve to alert the Settlers before they are ready with something devastating.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then how account for these pinpricks, as you call them, friend Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We will find out perhaps when we land on Solaria."},{"id":1725,"text":"It may be that Aurora is as curious as we are and the Settlers are and that that is another reason why they have cooperated with the, captain, even to the point of allowing Madam Gladia to accompany him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now Giskard's turn to remain silent."},{"id":1726,"text":"Finally he said, \"And what is this mysterious devastation that they plan?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Earlier, we spoke of a crisis arising from the Spacer plan to defeat Earth, but we used Earth in its general sense, implying the Earthpeople together with their descendents on the Settler worlds."},{"id":1727,"text":"However, if we seriously suspect the preparation of a devastating blow that will allow the Spacers to defeat their enemies at a stroke, we can perhaps refine our view."},{"id":1728,"text":"Thus, they cannot be planning a blow at a Settler world."},{"id":1729,"text":"Individually, the Settler worlds are dispensable and the remaining Settler worlds will promptly strike back."},{"id":1730,"text":"Nor can they be planning a blow at several or at all the Settler worlds."},{"id":1731,"text":"There are too many of them; they are too diffusely spread."},{"id":1732,"text":"It is not likely that all the strikes will succeed and those Settler worlds that survive will, in fury and despair, bring devastation upon the Spacer worlds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You reason, then, friend Daneel, that it will be a blow at Earth itself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, friend Giskard."},{"id":1733,"text":"Earth contains the vast majority of the short-lived, human beings; it is the perennial source of emigrants to the Settler worlds and is the chief raw material for the founding of new ones; it is the revered homeland of all the Settlers."},{"id":1734,"text":"If Earth were somehow destroyed, the Settler movement might never recover.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But would not the Settler worlds then retaliate as strongly and as forcefully as they would if one of themselves were destroyed?"},{"id":1735,"text":"That would seem to me to be inevitable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And to me, friend Giskard."},{"id":1736,"text":"Therefore, it seems to me that unless the Spacer worlds have gone insane, the blow would have to be a subtle one; one for which the Spacer worlds would seem to bear no responsibility.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why not such a subtle blow against the Settler worlds, which hold most of the actual war potential of the Earthpeople?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Either because the Spacers feel the blow against Earth would be more psychologically devastating or because the nature of the blow is such that it would work only against Earth and not against the Settler worlds."},{"id":1737,"text":"I suspect the latter, since Earth

madam?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not at all."},{"id":1914,"text":"They seem to be new, models."},{"id":1915,"text":"I can't remember them and I'm sure they can't remember me."},{"id":1916,"text":"If D."},{"id":1917,"text":"G was expecting anything hopeful to come of my supposed familiarity with the robots on my estate, he will have to be disappointed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"They do not seem to be doing anything, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia said, \"That is understandable."},{"id":1918,"text":"We're intruders and they've come to observe us and to report on us in accordance with what must be standing orders."},{"id":1919,"text":"They have no one now to report to, however, and can merely silently, observe."},{"id":1920,"text":"Without further orders, I presume they will do no more than that, but they won't cease doing so, either.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"It might be well, Madam Gladia, if we retired to our quarters on board ship."},{"id":1921,"text":"The captain is, I believe, supervising the construction of defenses and is not ready to go exploring yet."},{"id":1922,"text":"I suspect he will not approve your having left your quarters without his specific permission.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia said haughtily, \"I'm not going to delay stepping out onto the surface of my own world just to suit his whim.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I understand, but members of the crew are engaged in the vicinity and I believe that some note your presence here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And are approaching,\" said Giskard. \"If you would avoid infection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'm prepared,\" said Gladia. \"Nose plugs and gloves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia did not understand the nature of the structures being put up on the flat ground about the ship."},{"id":1923,"text":"For the most part, the crewmen, absorbed in the construction, had not seen Gladia and her two companions, standing as they were in the shadows. (It was the warm season on this portion of Solaria, which had a tendency to grow warmer-and on other occasions, colder-than Aurora did, since the Solarian day was nearly six hours longer than the Auroran day.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crewmen approaching were five in number and one of them, the tallest and largest, pointed in the direction of Gladia."},{"id":1924,"text":"The other four looked, remained standing for a while as though merely curious, and then, at a gesture from the first, approached again, changing their angle slightly so as to head directly for the Auroran three."},{"id":1925,"text":"Gladia watched them silently and with her eyebrows raised in contempt."},{"id":1926,"text":"Daneel and Giskard waited impassively."},{"id":1927,"text":"Giskard said in a low voice to Daneel, \"I do not know where the captain is."},{"id":1928,"text":"I cannot distinguish him from the crowd of crewmen in whose midst he must be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Shall we retire?\" said Daneel aloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That would be disgraceful,\" said Gladia. \"This is my world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe held her ground and the five crewmen came closer in leisurely fashion."},{"id":1929,"text":"They had been working, doing hard physical labor (Like robots, thought Gladia with distain) and they were sweating."},{"id":1930,"text":"Gladia became aware of the odor that reeked from them."},{"id":1931,"text":"That would have served to force her away more than threats would, but she held her ground even so."},{"id":1932,"text":"The nose plugs, she was sure, mitigated the effect of the smell."},{"id":1933,"text":"The large crewman approached more closely than the others."},{"id":1934,"text":"His skin was bronzed."},{"id":1935,"text":"His bare arms glistened with moisture and with shining musculature."},{"id":1936,"text":"He might be thirty (as nearly as Gladia could judge the age of these shortlived, beings) and if he were washed and properly dressed, he might prove quite presentable."},{"id":1937,"text":"He said, \"So you, are the Spacer lady from Aurora that we've been carrying on our ship?\" He spoke rather slowly, obviously trying to attain an aristocratic tinge to his Galactic."},{"id":1938,"text":"He failed, of course, and he spoke like a Settler-even more crudely than D.G."},{"id":1939,"text":"did."},{"id":1940,"text":"Gladia said, establishing her territorial rights, \"I am from Solaria, Settler,\" and stopped in confused embarrassment."},{"id":1941,"text":"She had spent so much time thinking of Solaria just now that twenty decades had dropped away and she had spoken with a thick Solarian accent."},{"id":1942,"text":"There was the broad \"a\" in Solaria and the rough \"r,\" while the \"I\" sounded horribly like \"Oi\"."},{"id":1943,"text":"She said again, in a much lower, less commanding voice, but one in which the accent of Aurora University-the standard for Galactic speech through all the Spacer worlds - rang clear, \"I am from Solaria, Settler.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Settler laughed and turned to the others. \"She speaks la-di-da, but she had to try."},{"id":1944,"text":"Right, mates?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe others laughed, too, and one cried out, \"Get her to talk some more, Niss."},{"id":1945,"text":"Maybe we can a learn to talk like Spacer birdies.\" And he placed one hand on his hip in as dainty a manner as he could manage, while holding the other hand out limply."},{"id":1946,"text":"Niss said, still smiling, \"Shut up, all of you.\" There was instant silence."},{"id":1947,"text":"He turned to Gladia again, \"I'm Berto Niss, First-Class Shipper."},{"id":1948,"text":"And your name, little woman?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia did not venture to speak again."},{"id":1949,"text":"Niss said, \"I'm being polite, little woman."},{"id":1950,"text":"I'm speaking gentlemanly."},{"id":1951,"text":"Spacer-like."},{"id":1952,"text":"I know you're old enough to be my great-grandmother."},{"id":1953,"text":"How old you are you, little woman?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Four hundred,\" shouted one of the crewmen from behind Niss, \"but she doesn't look it!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"She doesn't look one hundred,\" said another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"She looks suitable for a little ding-donging, said a third, \"and hasn't had any for a long time, I guess."},{"id":1954,"text":"Ask her if she'd want some, Niss."},{"id":1955,"text":"Be polite and ask if we -can take turns.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia flushed angrily and Daneel said, \"First-Class\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShipper Niss, your companions, are offending Madam Gladia."},{"id":1956,"text":"Would you retire?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNiss turned to look at Daneel, whom, till now, he had totally ignored."},{"id":1957,"text":"The smile vanished from his face and he said, \"Look, you."},{"id":1958,"text":"This little lady is off-limits."},{"id":1959,"text":"The captain said so."},{"id":1960,"text":"We won't bother her."},{"id":1961,"text":"Just a little harmless talk."},{"id":1962,"text":"That thing there is a robot."},{"id":1963,"text":"We won't bother with him and he can't hurt us."},{"id":1964,"text":"We know the Three Laws of Robotics."},{"id":1965,"text":"We order him to stay away from us, see."},{"id":1966,"text":"But you are a Spacer and the captain has give us no orders about you."},{"id":1967,"text":"So you\" -he pointed a finger---- \"stay out of this and don't interfere or you'll get your pretty skin all bruised up and then you might cry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said nothing."},{"id":1968,"text":"Niss nodded his head. \"Good."},{"id":1969,"text":"I like to see someone smart enough not to start anything he can't finish.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe turned to Gladia, \"Now, little Spacer woman, we will leave you alone because the captain doesn't want you bothered."},{"id":1970,"text":"If one of the men here made a crude remark, that's only natural."},{"id":1971,"text":"Just shake hands and let's be friends --Spacer, Settler, what's the difference?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe thrust out his hand toward Gladia, who shrank away in horror."},{"id":1972,"text":"Daneel's hand moved outward in a flick that was almost too fast to see and, caught Niss's wrist, \"First-Class Shipper Niss,\" he said quietly, \"do not attempt to touch the lady."},{"id":1973,"text":"Niss looked down at his hand and at the fingers that enclosed his wrist firmly."},{"id":1974,"text":"He said in a low and menacing growl, \"You have till the count of three to let go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel's hand fell away."},{"id":1975,"text":"He said, \"I must do as you say for I do not wish to harm you, but I must protect the lady and if she doesn't wish to be touched, as I believe she doesn't, I may be forced into a position where I must cause you pain."},{"id":1976,"text":"Please, accept my assurance that I will do all I can to minimize that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the crewmen shouted joyously, \"Give it to him, Niss."},{"id":1977,"text":"He's a talker.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNiss said, \"Look, Spacer, twice I told you to keep out and you touched me once."},{"id":1978,"text":"Now I tell you a third time and that's it."},{"id":1979,"text":"Make a move, say a word, and I take you apart."},{"id":1980,"text":"This little woman is going to shake hands, that's all, friendly like."},{"id":1981,"text":"Then we all go."},{"id":1982,"text":"Fair enough?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia said in a low choking voice."},{"id":1983,"text":"I won't be touched by him."},{"id":1984,"text":"Do what is necessary\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Sir, with all due respect, the lady does not wish to be touched."},{"id":1985,"text":"I must ask you-all of you-to leave.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNiss smiled and one large arm moved as though to brush Daneel to one side-and to do it hard."},{"id":1986,"text":"Daneel's, left arm flickered and once again Niss was held by the wrist. \"Please go, Sir, said Daneel."},{"id":1987,"text":"Niss's teeth continued to show, but he was no longer smiling."},{"id":1988,"text":"Violently, he brought his arm up."},{"id":1989,"text":"Daneel's enclosing hand moved up for a short distance, slowed, and came to a halt."},{"id":1990,"text":"His face showed no strain."},{"id":1991,"text":"His hand moved down, dragging Niss's arm with it, and then, with a rapid twist, he bent Niss's arm behind the Settler's broad back and held it there."},{"id":1992,"text":"Niss, who found himself unexpectedly with his back to Daneel, brought his other arm up over his head, groping for Daneel's neck."},{"id":1993,"text":"His other wrist was seized and pulled down farther than it could easily go and Niss grunted in clear misery."},{"id":1994,"text":"The other four crewmen, who had been watching in eager anticipation, remained in place now, motionless, silent, mouths open."},{"id":1995,"text":"Niss, staring at them, grunted, \"Help me!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"They will not help you, sir, for the captain's punishment will be all the worse if they try."},{"id":1996,"text":"I must ask you now to assure me that you will no longer trouble Madam Gladia and that you will leave quietly, all of you."},{"id":1997,"text":"Otherwise, I very much regret, First-Class Shipper, that I must pull your arms out of their sockets.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he said that, he tightened his grip on either wrist and Niss emitted a muffled grunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My apologies, sir,\" said Daneel, \"but I am under the strictest orders."},{"id":1998,"text":"May I have your assurance?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNiss kicked backward with sudden viciousness, but well before his -heavy boot could make contact, -Daneel had faded to one side and pulled him off-balance."},{"id":1999,"text":"He went facedown heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"May I have your assurance, sir?\" said Daneel, now pulling gently at the two wrists so that the crewman's arms lifted slightly up from the back."},{"id":2000,"text":"Niss howled and said, half-incoherent, \"I give in."},{"id":2001,"text":"Let go."},{"id":2002,"text":"I Daneel let go at once and stepped back."},{"id":2003,"text":"Slowly and painfully, Niss rolled over, moving his arms slowly and rotating his wrists with a twisted grimace."},{"id":2004,"text":"Then, when his right arm moved near the holster he wore, he snatched clumsily at his sidearm."},{"id":2005,"text":"Daneel's foot came down on his hand and pinned it to the ground. \"Don't do that, sir, or I may be forced to break one or more of the small bones in your hand.\" He bent down and extracted Niss's blaster from its holster. \"Now stand up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr."},{"id":2006,"text":"Niss,\" came another voice. \"Do as you are told and stand up.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD.G."},{"id":2007,"text":"Baley was -standing at their side, beard bristling, face slightly flushed, but his voice was dangerously calm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You four,\" he said, \"hand me your sidearms, one at a time."},{"id":2008,"text":"Come on."},{"id":2009,"text":"Move a little faster."},{"id":2010,"text":"One-two-three-four."},{"id":2011,"text":"Now continue to stand there at attention."},{"id":2012,"text":"Sir,\" this to Daneel-----\"give me that sidearm you are holding."},{"id":2013,"text":"Good."},{"id":2014,"text":"Five."},{"id":2015,"text":"And now, Mr."},{"id":2016,"text":"Niss, at attention.\" And he placed the blasters on the ground beside him."},{"id":2017,"text":"Niss stiffened to attention, eyes bloodshot, face contorted, in obvious pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Would someone,\" said D.G., \"please say what has been going on?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Captain,\" said Daneel quickly, \"Mr."},{"id":2018,"text":"Niss and I have had a playful altercation."},{"id":2019,"text":"No harm has been done.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mr."},{"id":2020,"text":"Niss, however, looks somewhat harmed, said D."},{"id":2021,"text":"G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No permanent harm, Captain,\" said Daneel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I see."},{"id":2022,"text":"Well, we'll get back to this later. -Madam.\" he turned on his heel to address Gladia----\"I don't recall that I gave you permission to emerge from the ship."},{"id":2023,"text":"You will go back to your cabin with your two companions at once."},{"id":2024,"text":"I am captain here and this is not Aurora."},{"id":2025,"text":"Do as I say!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel placed an apologetic hand on Gladia's elbow."},{"id":2026,"text":"Her chin lifted, but she, turned and went up the gangplank and into the ship, Daneel at her side, Giskard following."},{"id":2027,"text":"D.G."},{"id":2028,"text":"then turned to the crewmen. \"You five,\" he said, his voice never lifting from its flat calm, \"come with me."},{"id":2029,"text":"We'll get to the bottom of this -or of you.\" And he gestured to a petty officer to pick up the sidearms and take them away."},{"id":2030,"text":"D.G."},{"id":2031,"text":"stared at the five grimly."},{"id":2032,"text":"He was in his own quarters, the only portion of the ship that had a semblance of size to it and the beginnings of an appearance of luxury."},{"id":2033,"text":"He said, pointing to each in turn, \"Now, this is the way we'll work it."},{"id":2034,"text":"You tell me exactly what happened, word for word, motion for motion."},{"id":2035,"text":"When you're finished, you tell me anything that was wrong or left out."},{"id":2036,"text":"Then you the same, and then you, and then I'll get to you, Niss."},{"id":2037,"text":"I expect that you were all out of order, that you all did something unusually stupid that earned you all, but especially Niss, considerable humiliation."},{"id":2038,"text":"If, in your story, it would appear that you did nothing wrong and suffered no humiliation, then I'll know you're lying, especially as the Spacer woman will surely tell me what happened and I intend to believe every word she says."},{"id":2039,"text":"A lie will make matters worse for you than anything you've actually done."},{"id":2040,"text":"Now,\" he barked, \"start!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first crewman stumbled hastily through the story, and then the second, somewhat correcting, somewhat expanding, then the third and the fourth."},{"id":2041,"text":"D.G."},{"id":2042,"text":"listened, stony faced, to the recital, then motioned Berto, Niss to one side."},{"id":2043,"text":"He spoke to the other four, \"And while Niss was getting his face rightly mashed into the dirt by the Spacer, what were you four doing?"},{"id":2044,"text":"Watching?"},{"id":2045,"text":"Scared to move?"},{"id":2046,"text":"All four of you?"},{"id":2047,"text":"Against one man?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the men broke the thickening silence to say, \"It all happened, so quick, Captain."},{"id":2048,"text":"We we're just getting set to move in and then it was all over.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And what were you getting ready to do in case you did manage to get to move someday?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, we were going to pull the Spacer foreigner off our mate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you could have?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis time no one offered to make a sound."},{"id":2049,"text":"D.G."},{"id":2050,"text":"leaned toward them. \"Now, here I s the situation."},{"id":2051,"text":"You had no business with the foreigners, so you're fined one week's pay each."},{"id":2052,"text":"And now -let's get something straight."},{"id":2053,"text":"If you tell what has happened to anyone else-in the crew or out, now or ever, whether drunk or sober you'll be broken, every one of you, to apprentice shipper."},{"id":2054,"text":"It doesn't matter which one of you talks, you'll all four be broken, so keep an eye on each other."},{"id":2055,"text":"Now get to your assigned tasks and if you cross me at any time during this voyage, if you as much as hiccup against regulations, you'll be in the brig.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe four left, mournful, hangdog, tight-lipped."},{"id":2056,"text":"Niss remained, a bruise developing on his face, his arms clearly in discomfort."},{"id":2057,"text":"D.G."},{"id":2058,"text":"regarded him with a threatening quiet, while Niss stared to the left, to the right, at his feet, everywhere but at the face of the

woman."},{"id":2349,"text":"Her arms contracted and, for a moment, Daneel was lifted off the ground."},{"id":2350,"text":"Daneel's legs swung backward, then forward, pendulum like, using the points where the arms joined as a Pivot."},{"id":2351,"text":"His feet struck the woman with force and both fell heavily to the ground."},{"id":2352,"text":"Gladia, without putting the thought into words, realized that although the woman looked as human as Daneel did, she was just as nonhuman."},{"id":2353,"text":"A sense of instant outrage flooded Gladia, who was suddenly Solarian to the core-outrage that a robot should use force on a human being."},{"id":2354,"text":"Granted that she might somehow have recognized Daneel for what he was, but how dare she strike D.G."},{"id":2355,"text":"Gladia was running forward, screaming."},{"id":2356,"text":"It never occurred to her to fear a robot simply because it had knocked down a strong man with a blow and was battling an even stronger robot to a draw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How dare you?\" she screamed in a Solarian accent so thick that it grated on her own ear-but how else does one speak to a Solarian robot? \"How dare you,

upright."},{"id":2361,"text":"Daneel bent for the weapons, but Gladia waved him away furiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Give me those weapons, girl,\" she said."},{"id":2362,"text":"The woman said, \"Yes, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia snatched at them, chose the blaster swiftly, and handed it to Daneel. \"Destroy her when that seems best, Daneel."},{"id":2363,"text":"That's an order.\" She handed the neuronic whip to D.G."},{"id":2364,"text":"and said, \"This is useless here, except against me and yourself."},{"id":2365,"text":"Are you all right?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not all right,\" muttered D.G., rubbing one hip."},{"id":2366,"text":"Do you mean she's a robot?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Would a woman have thrown you like that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not any whom I have ever met, before."},{"id":2367,"text":"I said there might be, special robots on Solaria who were programmed to be dangerous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Gladia unkindly, \"but when you saw something that looked like your idea of a beautiful woman, you forgot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is easy to be wise after the fact.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia sniffed and turned again to the robot, \"What is your name, girl?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am called Landaree, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Get up, Landaree.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLandaree rose much as Daneel had-as though she were on springs."},{"id":2368,"text":"Her struggle with Daneel seemed to have left her, totally unharmed."},{"id":2369,"text":"Gladia said, \"Why, against the First Law, have you attacked these human beings?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said Landaree firmly, \"these are not human beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And do you say that I am not a human being?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, madam, you a human being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then, as a human being, I am defining these two men as human beings. -Do you hear me?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said Landaree a little more softly, \"these are not human beings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They are indeed human beings because I tell you they are."},{"id":2370,"text":"You are forbidden to attack them or harm them in any way."},{"id":2371,"text":"Landaree stood mute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do you understand what I have said?\" Gladia's voice grew more Solarian still as she reached for greater intensity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said Landaree, \"these are not human beings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said to Gladia softly, \"Madam, she has been given orders of such firmness that you cannot easily countervail them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We'll see about that,\" said Gladia, breathing quickly."},{"id":2372,"text":"Landaree looked about."},{"id":2373,"text":"The group -of robots, during the few minutes of conflict, had come closer to Gladia and her two companions."},{"id":2374,"text":"In the background were two robots who, Gladia decided, were not members of the original group and they were carrying between them, with some difficulty, a large and very massive device of some sort."},{"id":2375,"text":"Landaree gestured to them and they moved forward a bit more quickly."},{"id":2376,"text":"Gladia cried out, \"Robots, stop!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey stopped."},{"id":2377,"text":"Landaree said, \"Madam, I am fulfilling my duties."},{"id":2378,"text":"I am following my instructions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia said, \"Your duty, girl, is to obey my orders!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLandaree said, \"I cannot be ordered to disobey my instructions!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia said, \"Daneel, blast her!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterward, Gladia was able to reason out what had happened."},{"id":2379,"text":"Daneel's reaction time was much faster than a human being's would have been and he knew that he was facing a robot against which the Three Laws did not inhibit violence."},{"id":2380,"text":"However, she looked so human that even the precise knowledge that she was a robot did not totally overcome his inhibition."},{"id":2381,"text":"He followed the order more slowly than he should have."},{"id":2382,"text":"Landaree, whose definition of \"human being\" was clearly not the one Daneel used, was not inhibited by his appearance and she stuck the more quickly."},{"id":2383,"text":"She had her grip on the blaster and again the two struggled."},{"id":2384,"text":"D.G."},{"id":2385,"text":"turned his neuronic whip butt-first and came in at a half-run to strike."},{"id":2386,"text":"He hit her head squarely, but it had no effect on the robot and her leg sent him flailing backward."},{"id":2387,"text":"Gladia said, \"Robot!"},{"id":2388,"text":"Stop!\" Her clenched hands were raised."},{"id":2389,"text":"Landaree shouted in a stentorian contralto, \"All of you."},{"id":2390,"text":"Join

Gladia."},{"id":2393,"text":"The robots stopped, but the order had no effect on Landaree."},{"id":2394,"text":"Daneel held fast to the blaster, but was bending backward under the -force of Landaree's apparently greater strength."},{"id":2395,"text":"Gladia, in distraction, looked about as though hoping to find some weapon somewhere."},{"id":2396,"text":"D.G."},{"id":2397,"text":"was attempting to

unwavering. \"You are standing in front of something that looks like a human being but is not a human being."},{"id":2404,"text":"My instructions are to destroy such on sight.\" Then, in a louder, voice, \"You two porters -to the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two robots, carrying the massive device between them, renewed their forward movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Robots, stop!\" screamed Gladia and the forward motion stopped."},{"id":2405,"text":"Me robots trembled in place, as though attempting to move forward and yet not quite able to do so."},{"id":2406,"text":"Gladia said, \"You cannot

resolution, Captain."},{"id":2550,"text":"The fact that Lady Gladia was an undoubted human being, even by the overseer's definition, and that she was acting in such a way as to make it necessary,

a robot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that, had I succeeded in destroying her, I would have suffered some obstruction to the free positronic flow, no matter how thoroughly I understood her to be

possible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But, then, if your suspicion should be collect, that, would imply that it was possible to neutralize the First Law under specialized conditions."},{"id":2597,"text":"The

thought."},{"id":2949,"text":"Was it some form of amplification by a device so unobtrusive that she did not see it or was there a particularly clever acoustical shape to the hall?"},{"id":2950,"text":"She did not know, but she encouraged her puzzled speculation to continue, for it relieved her, for a while, of the necessity of having to listen to what was being said."},{"id":2951,"text":"At one point she heard a soft call of \"Quackenbush\" from some undetermined point in the audience."},{"id":2952,"text":"But for the perfect acoustics (if that was what it was), it would probably have gone unheard."},{"id":2953,"text":"The word meant nothing to her, but from the soft, brief titter of laughter that swept the audience, she suspected it was a vulgarism."},{"id":2954,"text":"The sound quenched itself almost at once and Gladia rather admired the depth of the silence that followed."},{"id":2955,"text":"Perhaps if the room were so perfectly acoustic that every sound could be heard, the audience had to be silent or the noise and confusion would be intolerable."},{"id":2956,"text":"Then, once the custom of silence was established and audience noise became a taboo, anything but silence would become unthinkable. -Except where the impulse to mutter \"Quackenbush\" became irresistible, she supposed."},{"id":2957,"text":"Gladia realized that her thinking was growing muddy ~ and her eyes were closing."},{"id":2958,"text":"She sat upright with a small jerk."},{"id":2959,"text":"The people of the planet were trying to honor her and if she fell asleep during the proceedings, that would surely be an intolerable insult."},{"id":2960,"text":"She tried to keep herself awake by listening, but that seemed to make her sleepier."},{"id":2961,"text":"She bit the inside of her cheeks instead and breathed deeply."},{"id":2962,"text":"Three officials spoke, one after the other, with semimerciful semibrevity, and then Gladia jolted wide awake (Had she been actually dozing despite all her efforts-with thousands of pairs of eyes on her?) as the spotlight fell just to her left and D.G."},{"id":2963,"text":"rose to speak, standing in front of his chair."},{"id":2964,"text":"He seemed completely at ease, with his thumbs hooked in his belt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Men and women of Baleyworld,\" he began. \"Officials, lawgivers, honored leaders, and fellow planetfolk, you have heard something of what happened on Solaria."},{"id":2965,"text":"You know that we were completely successful."},{"id":2966,"text":"You know that Lady Gladia of Aurora contributed to that success."},{"id":2967,"text":"It is time now to present some of the details to you and to all my fellow planetfolk who are watching on hypervision.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to describe the events in modified form and Gladia found herself dryly amused at the nature of the modifications."},{"id":2968,"text":"He passed over his own discomfiture at the hands of a humanoid robot lightly."},{"id":2969,"text":"Giskard was never mentioned; Daneel's role was minimized; and Gladia's heavily emphasized."},{"id":2970,"text":"The incident became a duel between two women-Gladia, and Landaree-and it was the courage and sense of authority of Gladia that had won out."},{"id":2971,"text":"Finally, D.G."},{"id":2972,"text":"said, \"And now Lady Gladia, Solarian by birth, Auroran by citizenship, but Baleyworlder by deed---\" (There was strong applause at the last, the loudest Gladia had yet heard, for the earlier speakers had been but

found the spotlight on herself and turned to D.G."},{"id":2975,"text":"in sudden panic."},{"id":2976,"text":"There was applause in her ears and D.G., too, was clapping his hands."},{"id":2977,"text":"Under the cover of the applause, he leaned toward her and whispered, \"You love them all, you want peace, and since you're not a legislator, you're unused to long speeches of small content."},{"id":2978,"text":"Say that, then sit down.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe looked at him uncompirehendingly, far too nervous to have heard what he said."},{"id":2979,"text":"She rose and found herself staring at endless tiers of people."},{"id":2980,"text":"Gladia felt very small (not for the first time in her life, to be sure) as she faced the stage."},{"id":2981,"text":"The men on the stage were all taller than she was and so were the other three women."},{"id":2982,"text":"She felt that even though they were all sitting and she was standing, they still towered over her."},{"id":2983,"text":"As for the audience, winch was waiting now in almost menacing silence, those who composed it were, she felt quite certain, one and all larger than her in every dimension."},{"id":2984,"text":"She took a deep breath and said, \"Friends---\" but it came out in a thin, breathless whistle."},{"id":2985,"text":"She cleared her throat (in what seemed a thunderous rasp) and tried again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Friends!\" This time there was a certain normality to the sound. \"You are all descended from Earthpeople, every one of you."},{"id":2986,"text":"I am descended from Earthpeople."},{"id":2987,"text":"There are no human beings anywhere on all the inhabited worlds whether Spacer worlds, Settler worlds, or Earth itself- that are not either Earthpeople by birth or Earthpeople by descent."},{"id":2988,"text":"All other differences fade to nothing in the face of that enormous fact."},{"id":2989,"text":"Her eyes flickered leftward to look at D.G."},{"id":2990,"text":"and she found that he was smiling very slightly and that one eyelid trembled as though it were about to wink."},{"id":2991,"text":"She went on. \"That should be our guide in every, thought and act."},{"id":2992,"text":"I thank you all for thinking of me as a fellow human being and for welcoming me among you without regard to any other classification in which you might have been tempted to place me."},{"id":2993,"text":"Because of that, and in the hope that the day will soon come when sixteen billion human beings, living in love and peace, will consider themselves as just, that and nothing more-or less-I think of you not merely as friends but as kinsmen and kinswomen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was an outbreak of applause that thundered in upon her and Gladia half-closed her eyes in relief."},{"id":2994,"text":"She remained standing to let it continue and bathe her in its welcome indication that she had spoken well and-what was more enough."},{"id":2995,"text":"When it began to fade, she smiled, bowed to right and left, and began to sit down."},{"id":2996,"text":"And then a voice came out of the audience. \"Why don't you speak in Solarian?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe froze halfway, to her seat and looked, in shock, at D.G."},{"id":2997,"text":"He shook his head slightly and mouthed soundlessly: \"Ignore it.\" He gestured as unobtrusively as possible that she seat herself."},{"id":2998,"text":"She stared -at him for a second or two, then realized what an ungainly sight she must present, with her posterior protruding in the unfinished process of seating herself."},{"id":2999,"text":"She straightened at once and flashed a smile at the audience as she turned her head slowly from side to side."},{"id":3000,"text":"For the first time she became aware of objects in the rear whose glistening lenses focused upon her."},{"id":3001,"text":"Of course!"},{"id":3002,"text":"D.G."},{"id":3003,"text":"had mentioned that the proceedings were being watched via hyperwave."},{"id":3004,"text":"Yet it scarcely seemed to matter now."},{"id":3005,"text":"She had spoken and had been applauded and she was facing the audience she could see, erect and without, nervousness."},{"id":3006,"text":"What could the unseen addition matter?"},{"id":3007,"text":"She said, still smiling, \"I consider that a friendly question."},{"id":3008,"text":"You want me to show you my accomplishments."},{"id":3009,"text":"How many want me to speak as a Solarian might?"},{"id":3010,"text":"Don't hesitate."},{"id":3011,"text":"Raise your right hands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA few right arms went up."},{"id":3012,"text":"Gladia said, \"The humanoid robot on Solaria heard me speak Solarian."},{"id":3013,"text":"That was what defeated it in the end."},{"id":3014,"text":"Come let me see everyone who would like a demonstration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore right arms went up and, in a moment, the audience became a sea of upraised arms."},{"id":3015,"text":"Gladia felt a hand tweaking at her pants leg and, with a rapid movement, she brushed it away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Very well."},{"id":3016,"text":"You may lower your arms now, kinsmen and kinswomen."},{"id":3017,"text":"Understand that what I speak now is Galactic Standard, which is your language, too."},{"id":3018,"text":"I, however, am speaking it as an Auroran would and I know you all understand me even though the way I pronounce my words may well strike you as amusing and my choice of words may on occasion puzzle you a bit."},{"id":3019,"text":"You'll notice that my way of speaking has notes to it and goes up and down almost as though I were singing my words."},{"id":3020,"text":"This always sounds ridiculous to anyone not an Auroran, even to other Spacers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, if I slip into the Solarian way of speaking as I am now doing, you will notice at once that the notes stop and that it becomes throaty with r's that just about neverrr let go-especially if therrre is no 'rrrr' anywherrrre on the vocal panoramarrrm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a burst of laughter from the audience and Gladia confronted it with a serious expression on her face."},{"id":3021,"text":"Finally, she held up her arms and made a cutting movement downward and outward and the laughter stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"However,\" she said, \"I will probably never go to Solaria again, so I will have no occasion to use the Solarian, dialect any further."},{"id":3022,"text":"And the good Captain Baley\" -she turned and made a half-bow in his direction, noting that there was a distinct outbreak, of perspiration on his brow ----- \"informs me there is no telling when I'll be going back to Aurora, so I may have to drop the Auroran dialect as well."},{"id":3023,"text":"My only choice, then, will be to speak the Baleyworld dialect, which I shall at once begin to practice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe hooked the fingers of each hand into an invisible belt, stretched her chest outward, pulled her chin downward, put on D.G.'s unselfconscious grin, and said, in a gravelly attempt at baritone, \"Men and women of Baleyworld, officials, lawgivers, honored leaders, and fellow planetfolk and that should include everyone, except, perhaps, dishonored leaders---\" She did her best to include the glottal stops and the flat \"a's\" and carefully pronounced the \"h\" of \"honored\" and \"dishonored\" in what was almost a gasp."},{"id":3024,"text":"The laughter was still louder this time and more prolonged and Gladia allowed herself to smile and to wait calmly while it went on and on."},{"id":3025,"text":"After all, she was persuading them to laugh at themselves."},{"id":3026,"text":"And when things were quiet again, she said simply, in an unexaggerated version of the Auroran dialect, \"Every dialect is amusing-or peculiar-to those who are not, accustomed to it and it tends to mark off human beings into separate-and frequently mutually unfriendly- groups."},{"id":3027,"text":"Dialects, however, are only languages of the tongue."},{"id":3028,"text":"Instead of those, you and I and every other human being on every inhabited world should listen to the language of the heart and there are no dialects to that."},{"id":3029,"text":"That language-if we will only listen-rings out the same in all of us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was it."},{"id":3030,"text":"She was ready to sit down again, but another question sounded."},{"id":3031,"text":"It was a woman's voice this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How old are you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow D.G."},{"id":3032,"text":"forced a low growl between his teeth. \"Sit down, madam!"},{"id":3033,"text":"Ignore the question.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia turned to face D.G."},{"id":3034,"text":"He had half-risen."},{"id":3035,"text":"The others on the stage, as nearly as she could see them in the dimness outside the spotlight, were tensely leaning toward her."},{"id":3036,"text":"She turned back to the audience and cried out ringingly,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The people here on the stage want me to sit down."},{"id":3037,"text":"How many of you out there want me to sit down? -I find you are silent. -How many want me to stand here and answer the question honestly?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was sharp applause and cries of \"Answer!"},{"id":3038,"text":"Answer!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia said, \"The voice of the people!"},{"id":3039,"text":"I'm sorry, D.G."},{"id":3040,"text":"and all the rest of you, but I am commanded to speak.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe looked up at the spotlight, squinting, and shouted, \"I don't know who controls the lights, but light the auditorium and turn off the spotlight."},{"id":3041,"text":"I don't care what it does to the hyperwave cameras."},{"id":3042,"text":"Just make sure the sound is going out accurately."},{"id":3043,"text":"No one will care if I look dim, as long as they can hear me."},{"id":3044,"text":"Right?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" came the multivoiced answer."},{"id":3045,"text":"Then \"Lights!"},{"id":3046,"text":"Lights!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomeone on the stage signaled in a distraught manner and the audience was bathed in light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Much better,\" said Gladia. \"Now I can see you all, my kinspeople."},{"id":3047,"text":"I would like, particularly, to see the woman who asked the question, the one who wants to know my age."},{"id":3048,"text":"I would like to speak to her directly."},{"id":3049,"text":"Don't be backward or shy."},{"id":3050,"text":"If you have the courage to ask the question, you should have the courage to ask it openly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe waited and finally a woman rose in the middle distance."},{"id":3051,"text":"Her dark hair was pulled back tightly, the color of her skin was a light brown, and her clothing, worn tightly to emphasize a slim figure, was in shades of darker brown."},{"id":3052,"text":"She said, just a bit stridently, \"I'm not afraid to stand up."},{"id":3053,"text":"And I'm not afraid to ask the question again."},{"id":3054,"text":"How old are you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia faced her calmly and found herself even welcoming the confrontation. (How was this possible?"},{"id":3055,"text":"Throughout her first three decades, she had been carefully trained to find the real presence of even one human being intolerable."},{"id":3056,"text":"Now look at her-facing thousands without a tremble."},{"id":3057,"text":"She was vaguely astonished and entirely pleased.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia said, \"Please remain standing, madam, and let us talk together."},{"id":3058,"text":"How shall we measure age?"},{"id":3059,"text":"In elapsed years since birth?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe woman said with composure \"My name is Sindra Lambid."},{"id":3060,"text":"I'm a member of the legislature and therefore one of Captain Baley's 'lawgivers' and 'honored leaders.' I hope 'honored,' at any rate.\" (There was a ripple of laughter as the audience seemed to grow increasingly good-natured.) \"To answer your question, I think that the number of Galactic Standard Years that have elapsed since birth is the usual definition of a person's age."},{"id":3061,"text":"Thus, I am fifty-four years old."},{"id":3062,"text":"How old are you?"},{"id":3063,"text":"How about just giving us a figure?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I will do so."},{"id":3064,"text":"Since my birth, two hundred and thirtythree Galactic Standard Years have come and gone, so that I am over twenty-three decades old-or a little more than four times as old as you are.\" Gladia held herself straight and she knew that her small, slim figure and the dim light made her look extraordinarily childlike at that moment."},{"id":3065,"text":"There was a confused babble from the audience and something of a groan from her left."},{"id":3066,"text":"A quick glance in that direction showed her that D.G."},{"id":3067,"text":"had his hand to his forehead."},{"id":3068,"text":"Gladia said, \"But that is an entirely passive way of measuring time lapse."},{"id":3069,"text":"It is a measure of quantity that takes no account of quality."},{"id":3070,"text":"My life has been spent quietly, one might say dully."},{"id":3071,"text":"I have drifted through a set routine, shielded from all untoward events by a smoothly functioning social system that left no room for either change or experimentation and by my robots, who stood between me and misadventure of any kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Only twice in my life have I experienced the breath Of excitement and both times tragedy was involved."},{"id":3072,"text":"When I was thirty-three, younger in years than many of you who are now listening to me, there was a time-not a long one during which a murder accusation hung over me."},{"id":3073,"text":"Two years later, there was another period of time-not long during which I was involved in another murder."},{"id":3074,"text":"On both those occasions, Plainclothesman Elijah Baley, was at my side."},{"id":3075,"text":"I believe most of you-or perhaps all of you-are familiar with the story as given in the account written by Elijah Baley's son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I should now add a third occasion for, this last month, I have faced a great deal of excitement, reaching its climax with my being required to stand up before you all, something which is entirely different from anything I have ever done in all my long life."},{"id":3076,"text":"And I must admit it is only your own good nature and kind acceptance of me that makes it possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Consider, each of you, the contrast of all this with your own lives, You are pioneers and you live on a pioneer world."},{"id":3077,"text":"This world has been growing all your lives and will continue to grow."},{"id":3078,"text":"This world is anything but settled down and each day is-and must be-an adventure."},{"id":3079,"text":"The very climate is an adventure."},{"id":3080,"text":"You have first cold, then heat, then cold again."},{"id":3081,"text":"It is a climate rich in wind and storms and sudden change."},{"id":3082,"text":"At no time can you sit back and let time pass drowsily in a world that changes gently or not at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Many Baleyworlders are Traders or, can choose to be Traders and can then spend half their time scouring the space lanes."},{"id":3083,"text":"And if ever this world grows tame, many of its inhabitants can choose to transfer their sphere of activities to another less-developed world or join an expedition that will find a suitable world that has not yet felt the step of human beings and take their share in shaping it and seeding it and making it fit for human occupancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Measure the length of life by events and deeds, accomplishments and excitements, and I am a child, younger than any of you."},{"id":3084,"text":"The large number of my years has served merely to bore and weary me; the smaller number of yours to enrich and excite you. -So tell me again, Madam Lambid, how old are you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLambid smiled. \"Fifty-four good years, Madam Gladia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe sat down and again the applause welled up and continued."},{"id":3085,"text":"Under cover of that, D.G."},{"id":3086,"text":"said hoarsely, \"Lady\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia, who taught you how to handle an audience like this?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No one,\" she whispered back. \"I never tried before.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But quit while you're

down."},{"id":3090,"text":"We will tackle Old Man Bistervan ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But I'm not tired,\" said Gladia. \"I'm enjoying myself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man now facing her from her extreme right but rather near the stage was a tall, vigorous man with shaggy white eyebrows hanging over his eyes."},{"id":3091,"text":"His thinning hair was also white and his garments were a somber black, relieved by a white stripe running down each sleeve and trouser leg, as though setting sharp limits to his body."},{"id":3092,"text":"His voice was deep and musical. \"My name,\" he said, \"is Tomas Bistervan and I'm known to many as the Old Man, largely, I think, because they wish I were and that I would not delay too long in dying."},{"id":3093,"text":"I do not know how to address you

live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Robots vary in complexity, ability, and intelligence and these two rate very high in those respects."},{"id":3165,"text":"Daneel, in particular, is, in my opinion, the robot, of all robots, whose intelligence most nearly approximates the human in those areas where comparison is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have brought only Daneel and Giskard with me, but they perform no great services for me."},{"id":3166,"text":"If you are interested, I dress myself, bathe myself, use my own utensils when I eat, and walk without being carried.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do I use them for

certainly need no protection on this platform."},{"id":3171,"text":"After all, there is a force field stretched across the stage that is ample protection."},{"id":3172,"text":"It is not there at my

Earth of its Spacer overlords, who initiated the new policy of settlement, and whose son led the first human being to Baleyworld-why else is it called that?-know that well before he knew me, Elijah Baley worked with Daneel."},{"id":3173,"text":"He worked with him on Earth, on Solaria, and on Aurora-on each of his great cases."},{"id":3174,"text":"To Daneel, Elijah Baley was always 'Partner Elijah.' I don't know if that fact appears in his biography, but you may safely take my word for it."},{"id":3175,"text":"And although Elijah Baley, as an Earthman, began with a strong distrust of Daneel, a friendship between them developed."},{"id":3176,"text":"When Elijah Baley was dying, here on this planet over sixteen decades ago, when it was just a cluster of prefabricated houses surrounded by garden patches, it was not his son who was with him in his last moment."},{"id":3177,"text":"Nor was it I\" (For a treacherous moment, she thought her voice would not hold steady.) \"He sent for Daneel and he held on to life until Daneel arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this is Daneel's second visit to this planet."},{"id":3178,"text":"I was with him, but I remained in orbit.\" (Steady!) \"It was Daneel alone who made planetfall, Daneel who received his last words. -Well, does this mean nothing to you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHer voice rose a notch as she shook her fists in the air. \"Must I tell you this?"},{"id":3179,"text":"Don't you already know it?"},{"id":3180,"text":"Here is the robot that Elijah Baley loved."},{"id":3181,"text":"Yes, loved."},{"id":3182,"text":"I wanted to see Elijah before he died, to say good-bye to him; but he wanted Daneel-and this is Daneel."},{"id":3183,"text":"This is the very one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And this other is Giskard, who knew Elijah only on Aurora, but who managed to save Elijah's life there. ~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Without these two robots, Elijah Baley would not have achieved his goal."},{"id":3184,"text":"The Spacer worlds would still be supreme, the Settler worlds would not exist, and none of you would be here."},{"id":3185,"text":"I know that."},{"id":3186,"text":"You know that."},{"id":3187,"text":"I wonder if Mr."},{"id":3188,"text":"Tomas

hyperwave bear the name of Daneel or Giskard?"},{"id":3192,"text":"Well, these robots behind me are the robots those names commemorate."},{"id":3193,"text":"And are they to be denounced by Tomas

finish."},{"id":3196,"text":"I have not told you why I brought these two robots.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was immediate silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"These two robots,\" Gladia said, \"have never forgotten Elijah Baley, any-more than I have forgotten him."},{"id":3197,"text":"The passing decades have not in the least dimmed those memories."},{"id":3198,"text":"When I was ready to step on to Captain Baley's ship, when I knew that I might visit Baleyworld, how could I refuse to take Daneel and Giskard with me?"},{"id":3199,"text":"They wanted to see the planet that Elijah Baley had made possible, the planet on which he passed his old age and on which he died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are robots, but they are intelligent robots who served Elijah Baley faithfully and well."},{"id":3200,"text":"It is not enough to have respect for all human beings; one must have respect for all intelligent beings."},{"id":3201,"text":"So I brought them here.\" Then, in a final outcry that demanded a response, \"Did I do wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe received her response."},{"id":3202,"text":"A gigantic cry of \"No!\" resounded throughout the hall and everyone was on his or her feet, clapping, stamping, roaring, screaming-on ..."},{"id":3203,"text":"and on ..."},{"id":3204,"text":"and on."},{"id":3205,"text":"Gladia watched, smiling, and, as the noise continued endlessly, became aware of two things."},{"id":3206,"text":"First, she was wet with perspiration."},{"id":3207,"text":"Second, she was happier than she had ever been in her life."},{"id":3208,"text":"It, was as though all her life, she had waited for this moment-the moment when she, having been brought up in isolation, could finally learn, after twenty-three decades, that she could face crowds, and move them, and bend them to her will."},{"id":3209,"text":"She listened to the unwearying, noisy response-on ..."},{"id":3210,"text":"and on..."},{"id":3211,"text":"and on ..."},{"id":3212,"text":"It was a considerable time later -how long she had no way of telling-that Gladia finally -came to herself."},{"id":3213,"text":"There had first been unending noise, the solid wedge of security people herding her through the crowd, the plunge into endless tunnels that seemed to sink deeper and deeper into the ground."},{"id":3214,"text":"She lost contact with D.G."},{"id":3215,"text":"early and was not sure that Daneel and Giskard were safely with her."},{"id":3216,"text":"She wanted to ask for them, but only faceless, people surrounded her."},{"id":3217,"text":"She thought distantly that the robots had to be with her, for they would resist separation and she would hear the tumult if an attempt were made."},{"id":3218,"text":"When she finally reached a room, the two robots were there with her."},{"id":3219,"text":"She didn't know precisely where she was, but the room was fairly large and clean."},{"id":3220,"text":"It was poor stuff compared to her home on Aurora, but compared to the shipboard cabin it was quite luxurious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You will be safe here, madam,\" said the last of the, guards as he left. \"If you need anything, just let us know.\" He indicated a device on a small table next to the bed."},{"id":3221,"text":"She stared at it, but by the time she turned back to ask what it was and how it worked, he was gone."},{"id":3222,"text":"Oh, well, she thought, I'll get by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Giskard,\" she said wearily, \"find out which of those doors leads to the bathroom and find out how the shower works."},{"id":3223,"text":"What I must have now is a shower.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe sat down gingerly, I aware that she was damp and unwilling to saturate the chair with her perspiration."},{"id":3224,"text":"She was beginning to ache with the unnatural rigidity of her position when Giskard emerged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Madam, the shower is running,\" he said, \"and the temperature is adjusted."},{"id":3225,"text":"There is a solid material which I believe is soap and a primitive sort of toweling material, along with various other articles that may be useful.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Giskard,\" said Gladia, quite aware that despite her grandiloquence on the manner in which robots such as Giskard did not perform menial service, that is precisely what she, had required him to do."},{"id":3226,"text":"But circumstances alter cases\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf she had never needed a shower, it seemed to her, as badly as now, she had also never enjoyed one as much."},{"id":3227,"text":"She remained in it much longer than she had to and when it was over it didn't even occur to her to wonder if the towels had been in any way irradiated to sterility until after she had dried herself-and by that time it was too late,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe rummaged about among the material Giskard had laid out for her- powder, deodorant, comb, toothpaste, hair dryer-but she could not locate anything that would serve as a toothbrush."},{"id":3228,"text":"She finally gave up and used her finger, which she found most unsatisfactory."},{"id":3229,"text":"There was no hairbrush and that too was unsatisfactory."},{"id":3230,"text":"She scrubbed the comb with soap before using it, but cringed away from it just the same."},{"id":3231,"text":"She found a garment that looked as though it were suitable for wearing to bed."},{"id":3232,"text":"It smelled clean, but it hung far too loosely, she decided."},{"id":3233,"text":"Daneel said quietly, \"Madam, the captain wishes to know if he may see you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so,\" said Gladia, still rummaging for alternate nightwear. \"Let

if you can be served and you can carry on from there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Good."},{"id":3240,"text":"I will need a toothbrush, a hairbrush, and clothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The toothbrush and hairbrush I will see that you get."},{"id":3241,"text":"As for clothing, that has been thought of."},{"id":3242,"text":"You have a clothes bag hanging in your closet."},{"id":3243,"text":"You'll find it contains

centuries ago, I would have made the discovery then."},{"id":3299,"text":"Had I never faced so many at once, then I would never have made the discovery at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Consider, then, how many vital points I might easily grasp, but never have and never will, simply because the proper conditions for it will never come my way."},{"id":3300,"text":"I remain ignorant except where

discovered that it could be done without harming her."},{"id":3303,"text":"Was that your discovery?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"Friend Daneel, actually all I dared do was loosen a very few strands of inhibition, only enough to allow her to speak a few words, so that she might be heard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But she did far more than that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"After this microscopic adjustment, I turned to the multiplicity of minds I faced in the audience."},{"id":3304,"text":"I had never experienced so many, any more than Lady Gladia had, and I was as taken aback as she was."},{"id":3305,"text":"I found, at first, that I could do nothing in the vast mental interlockingness that beat in upon me."},{"id":3306,"text":"I felt helpless.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And then I noted small friendlinesses, curiosities, interests-I cannot describe them in words-with a color of sympathy for Lady Gladia about them."},{"id":3307,"text":"I played with what I could find that had this color of sympathy, tightening and thickening them just slightly."},{"id":3308,"text":"I wanted some small response in Lady Gladia's, favor that might encourage her, that might make it unnecessary for me to be tempted to tamper further with Lady Gladia's mind."},{"id":3309,"text":"That was all I did."},{"id":3310,"text":"I do not know how many threads of the proper color I handled."},{"id":3311,"text":"Not many.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"And what then, friend Giskard?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I found, friend Daneel, that I had begun something that was autocatalytic."},{"id":3312,"text":"Each thread I strengthened, strengthened a nearby thread of the same kind and the two together strengthened several others nearby."},{"id":3313,"text":"I had to do nothing further."},{"id":3314,"text":"Small stirs, small sounds, and small glances that seemed to approve of what Lady Gladia said encouraged still others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then I found something stranger yet."},{"id":3315,"text":"All these little indications of approval, which I could detect only because the minds were open to me, Lady Gladia must have also detected in some manner, for further inhibitions in her mind fell without my touching them."},{"id":3316,"text":"She began to speak faster, more confidently, and the audience responded better than ever-without my doing anything."},{"id":3317,"text":"And in the end, there was hysteria, a storm, a tempest of mental - thunder and lightning so intense that I had to close my mind to it or it would have overloaded my circuits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Never, in all my existence, had I encountered anything like that and yet it started with no more modification introduced by me in all that crowd than I have, in the past,

hyperwave.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"I do not see how this can be, friend Giskard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nor I, friend Daneel."},{"id":3319,"text":"I am not human."},{"id":3320,"text":"I do not directly experience the possession of a human mind with all its complexities and contradictions, so I do not grasp the mechanisms by which they respond."},{"id":3321,"text":"But, apparently, crowds are more easily managed than individuals."},{"id":3322,"text":"It seems paradoxical."},{"id":3323,"text":"Much weight takes more effort to move than little weight."},{"id":3324,"text":"Much energy

than few?"},{"id":3327,"text":"You think like a human being, friend Daneel."},{"id":3328,"text":"Can you explain?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"You yourself, friend Giskard, said that it was an autocatalytic effect, a matter of contagion."},{"id":3329,"text":"A single spark of flame may end by burning down a forest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard paused and seemed deep in thought."},{"id":3330,"text":"Then he said, \"It is not reason that is contagious but emotion."},{"id":3331,"text":"Madam Gladia chose arguments she felt would move her audience's feelings."},{"id":3332,"text":"She did not attempt to reason with them."},{"id":3333,"text":"It may be, then, that the larger the crowd, the more easily they are swayed by emotion rather than by reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Since emotions are few and reasons are many, the behavior of a crowd can be more easily predicted than the behavior of one person can."},{"id":3334,"text":"And that, in turn, means that if laws are to be developed that enable the current of history to be predicted, then one must deal with large populations, the larger the better."},{"id":3335,"text":"That might itself be the First Law of Psychohistory, the key to the study of Humanics."},{"id":3336,"text":"Yet----\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It strikes me that it has taken me so long to understand this only because I am not a human being."},{"id":3337,"text":"A human being would, perhaps, instinctively understand his own mind well enough to know how to handle others like himself."},{"id":3338,"text":"Madam Gladia, with no experience at all in addressing huge crowds, carried off the matter, expertly."},{"id":3339,"text":"How much better off we would be if we had someone like, Elijah Baley with us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFriend Daneel, are you not thinking of him?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Can you see his image in my mind?"},{"id":3340,"text":"That is surprising, friend Giskard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do not see him, friend Daneel."},{"id":3341,"text":"I cannot receive your thoughts."},{"id":3342,"text":"But I can sense emotions and mood-and your mind has a texture which, by past experience, I know to be associated with Elijah Baley.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Madam Gladia made mention of the fact that I was the last to see Partner Elijah alive, so I listen again, in memory, to that moment."},{"id":3343,"text":"I think again of what he said.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why, friend Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I search for the meaning."},{"id":3344,"text":"I feel it was important.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How could what he said have meaning beyond the import of the words?"},{"id":3345,"text":"Had there been hidden meaning, Elijah Baley would have expressed it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Daneel slowly, \"Partner Elijah did not himself understand the significance of what he was saying.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMemory!"},{"id":3346,"text":"It lay in Daneel's mind like a closed book of infinite detail, always available for his use."},{"id":3347,"text":"Some passages were called upon frequently for their information, but only a very few were called upon merely because Daneel wished to feel their texture."},{"id":3348,"text":"Those very few were, for the most part, those that contained Elijah Baley."},{"id":3349,"text":"Many decades ago, Daneel had come to Baleyworld while Elijah Baley was still alive."},{"id":3350,"text":"Madam Gladia had come with him, but after they entered into orbit about Baleyworld, Bentley Baley soared upward in his small ship to meet them and was brought aboard."},{"id":3351,"text":"By then, he was a rather gnarled man of middle age."},{"id":3352,"text":"He looked at Gladia with faintly hostile eyes and said, \"You cannot see him, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Gladia, who had been weeping, said, \"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He does not wish it, madam, and I must respect his wishes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cannot believe that, Mr."},{"id":3353,"text":"Baley.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have a handwritten note and I have a voice recording, madam."},{"id":3354,"text":"I do not know if you can recognize his

alone."},{"id":3355,"text":"Then she emerged-with an air of defeat about her-but she managed to say firmly, \"Daneel, you are to go down alone to see him."},{"id":3356,"text":"It is his wish."},{"id":3357,"text":"But you are to report to me everything that is done and said.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam,\" Daneel said."},{"id":3358,"text":"Daneel went down, in Bentley's ship and

is your father?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He is dying,\" Bentley said with perhaps conscious brutality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I understand that, too,\" said Daneel, his voice quivering noticeably, not out of ordinary emotion but because the consciousness of the death of a human being, however unavoidable, disordered his positronic brain paths. \"I mean, how much longer before he must die?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He should have died some time ago."},{"id":3364,"text":"He is tied to life because he refuses to go, until he sees you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey landed."},{"id":3365,"text":"It was a large world, but the inhabited portion-if this were all-was small and shabby."},{"id":3366,"text":"It was a cloudy day and it had rained recently."},{"id":3367,"text":"The wide, straight streets were empty, as though what population existed there was in no mood to assemble in order to stare at a robot."},{"id":3368,"text":"The ground-car took them through the emptiness and brought them to a house somewhat larger and more impressive than most."},{"id":3369,"text":"Together they entered."},{"id":3370,"text":"At an inner door, Bentley halted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My father is in."},{"id":3371,"text":"there,\" he said sadly. \"You are to go in alone."},{"id":3372,"text":"He will not have me there with you."},{"id":3373,"text":"Go in You might not recognize him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel went into the, gloom of the room."},{"id":3374,"text":"His eyes adjusted rapidly and he was aware of a body covered by a sheet inside a transparent cocoon that was made visible only by its faint glitter."},{"id":3375,"text":"The light within the room brightened a bit and Daneel could then see the face clearly."},{"id":3376,"text":"Bentley had been right."},{"id":3377,"text":"Daneel saw nothing of his old partner in it."},{"id":3378,"text":"It was gaunt and bony."},{"id":3379,"text":"The eyes were closed and it seemed to Daneel that what he saw was a dead body."},{"id":3380,"text":"He had never seen a dead human being and when this thought struck him, he staggered and it seemed to him that his legs would not hold him up."},{"id":3381,"text":"But the old-man's eyes opened and Daneel recovered his equilibrium, though he continued to feel an unaccustomed weakness just the same."},{"id":3382,"text":"The eyes looked at him and a small, faint smile curved the pale, cracked lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Daneel."},{"id":3383,"text":"My old friend Daneel."},{"id":3384,"text":"There was the faint timbre of Elijah Baley's remembered voice in that whispered sound."},{"id":3385,"text":"An arm emerged slowly from under the sheet and it seemed to Daneel that he recognized Elijah after all."},{"id":3386,"text":"Partner Elijah,\" he said softly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thank you-thank you for coming.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It was important for me to come, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid they might not allow

should not have let you see me like this, but I was too weak to resist my desire to see you once again.\" Baley's voice seemed to have grown a bit stronger, as though it had been fortified by the

been then?"},{"id":3447,"text":"A small world, a trickle of farms, a handful of towns clustered along natural lines of communication."},{"id":3448,"text":"The total population had been no more than five million and its most important exports had been raw wool and some titanium."},{"id":3449,"text":"The Spacers had ignored them completely under the more or less benign influence of Han Fastolfe of

increase in numbers and strength, the time would soon come when life would be again secure."},{"id":3456,"text":"The Settlers would live in peace and develop their own technology to the utmost."},{"id":3457,"text":"As Baleyworld filled, it would assume the proportion and ways of another Earth, as would all the worlds, while new ones would spring up here and there in ever greater numbers, finally making up the great Galactic Empire to come."},{"id":3458,"text":"And surely Baleyworld, as the oldest and most populous of the Settler worlds, would always have a prime place in that

move forward with confidence."},{"id":3465,"text":"Somehow the Settlers had to hold off the Spacers till the balance had shifted sufficiently."},{"id":3466,"text":"And the task of keeping the Spacers quiet and the Settlers at once resolute and yet sensible fell more upon Pandaral's shoulders than on anyone else's-and it was a task he neither liked nor wanted."},{"id":3467,"text":"Now it was morning, a cold, gray morning with more snow coming-though that was no surprise-and he made his way through the, hotel alone."},{"id":3468,"text":"He wanted no retinue."},{"id":3469,"text":"The

robots, something that allows us to build new worlds with our own hands; the rapid succession of generations, which makes for constant change; and, most of all, the Earth, which gives us our central

lead."},{"id":3800,"text":"And the Spacer worlds, calm and secure, would then have expanded further, Fastolfe had always complained that the Spacers were too long-lived and too comfortable on their robotic cushions to be pioneers, but Amadiro would have proved him wrong."},{"id":3801,"text":"Yet Fastolfe had won out."},{"id":3802,"text":"At the moment of certain defeat, he had somehow, unbelievably, incredibly, reached into empty space, so to speak, and found victory in- his grasp-plucked from nowhere."},{"id":3803,"text":"It was that Earthman, of course, Elijah Baley\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Amadiro's otherwise uncomfortable memory always balked at the Earthman and turned away."},{"id":3804,"text":"He could not picture that face, hear that voice, remember that

touch them."},{"id":3815,"text":"The facts, the figures, the indisputable worsening of affairs from decade to decade left them unmoved."},{"id":3816,"text":"How was it possible to shout the truth at them so steadily, to have every prediction he made come to pass, and yet to have to watch a steady majority following Fastolfe like sheep?"},{"id":3817,"text":"How was it possible that Fastolfe himself could watch everything he said prove to be sheer folly and yet never swerve from his policies?"},{"id":3818,"text":"It was not even that he stubbornly insisted on being wrong, it was that he simply never seemed to notice he was wrong."},{"id":3819,"text":"If Amadiro were the kind of man who doted on fantasy, he would surely imagine that some kind of spell, some kind Of apathetic enchantment, had fallen upon the Spacer worlds."},{"id":3820,"text":"He would imagine that somewhere someone possessed the magic power of lulling otherwise active brains and blinding to the truth otherwise sharp eyes."},{"id":3821,"text":"To add the final exquisite agony, people pitied Fastolfe for having died in frustration."},{"id":3822,"text":"In frustration, they said, because the Spacers would not seize new worlds of their own."},{"id":3823,"text":"It was Fastolfe's own policies that kept them from doing so!"},{"id":3824,"text":"What right had he to feel frustration over that?"},{"id":3825,"text":"What would he do if he had, like Amadiro, always seen and spoken the truth and been unable to force the Spacers enough Spacers-to listen to him."},{"id":3826,"text":"How many times had he thought that it would be better for the Galaxy to be empty than under the domination of the submen?"},{"id":3827,"text":"H he had some magic power to, destroy the Earth-Elijah Baley's world-with a nod of his head, how eagerly he would."},{"id":3828,"text":"Yet to find refuge in such fantasy could only be a sign of his total despair."},{"id":3829,"text":"It was the other side of his recurrent, futile wish Ito give up and welcome death-if his robots would allow it."},{"id":3830,"text":"And then the time came when the power to destroy Earth was given him-even forced upon him against his will."},{"id":3831,"text":"That time was some three-fourths of a decade before, when he had first met Levular Mandamus."},{"id":3832,"text":"Memory!"},{"id":3833,"text":"Three-fourths of a decade before\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro looked up and noted that Maloon Cicis had entered the

drastically noticeable, just a general air of mild decay."},{"id":3839,"text":"His nose seemed to be a bit more asymmetrical than it once had been."},{"id":3840,"text":"He rubbed his own somewhat bulbous nose and wondered how badly the flavor of decay was enveloping him."},{"id":3841,"text":"He had once been 1.95 meters tall, a good height even by Spacer standards."},{"id":3842,"text":"Surely he stood as straight now as he always had and yet when he had actually measured his height recently, he could not manage to make it more than 1.93 meters."},{"id":3843,"text":"Was he beginning to stoop, to shrivel, to settle?"},{"id":3844,"text":"He put away these dour thoughts that were themselves a surer sign of aging than mere measurements and said, \"What is it, Maloon?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCicis had a new personal robot dogging his steps very modernistic and with glossy trim."},{"id":3845,"text":"That was a sign of aging, too."},{"id":3846,"text":"If one can't keep one's body young, one can always buy a new young robot."},{"id":3847,"text":"Amadiro was determined never to rouse smiles among the truly young by falling prey to that particular delusion-

the papers on his desk and then said quickly, without looking up, \"Where did you learn Latin?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do not know Latin well enough to speak it or read it but I know enough about it to

only at the beginning of a long life and might have thirty decades ahead of him; Amadiro had only eight to ten at the very most."},{"id":3919,"text":"And Amadiro, thinking of what the young man had said, felt, with increasing restlessness, that he could not take the chance that a way of destroying Earth might exist and, that he might be ignoring it."},{"id":3920,"text":"Could he allow the destruction to take place after his death, so that he would not witness it?"},{"id":3921,"text":"Or, almost as bad, have it take place during his lifetime, but with someone else's mind in command, someone else's fingers on the contact?"},{"id":3922,"text":"No, he had to see it, witness it, and do it, else why had he endured his long frustration?"},{"id":3923,"text":"Mandamus might be a fool or a madman, but, in that case, Amadiro had to know for certain that he was a fool or a madman."},{"id":3924,"text":"Having reached that point in his thinking, Amadiro called Mandamus to his office."},{"id":3925,"text":"Amadiro realized that in so doing, he was humiliating himself, but the humiliation was the price he had to pay to make certain that there wasn't the slightest chance of Earth being destroyed without him."},{"id":3926,"text":"It was a price he was willing to pay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe steeled himself even for the possibility that Mandamus would enter his presence, smirking and contemptuously triumphant."},{"id":3927,"text":"He would have to endure that, too."},{"id":3928,"text":"After the endurance, of course, if the young man's suggestion proved foolish, he would see him punished to the full extent that a civilized society would permit, but otherwise\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was pleased, then, when Mandamus entered his office with an attitude of reasonable humility and thanked him, in all apparent sincerity, for a second interview."},{"id":3929,"text":"It seemed to Amadiro he would have to be gracious in his

will dismiss you again, but without contempt on my part, and I hope that you will, respond without anger on your part.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus said, \"I could not be angry at having been accorded a

would be ingenious enough to work out a plan for the destruction of our particular Carthage and I wouldn't be back here at your call.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor an instant, Amadiro felt a fire blaze within him."},{"id":3952,"text":"For that instant, he felt that even Earth's destruction was not worth enduring this hectoring attitude from a child."},{"id":3953,"text":"But only for that instant."},{"id":3954,"text":"Then his sense of due proportion was back and he could even tell himself that a person so young, yet so bold and so icily sure of himself, was the kind of man he needed."},{"id":3955,"text":"Besides, he had studied Mandamus's record and there was no question that he qualified for the Institute."},{"id":3956,"text":"Amadiro said evenly (at some cost to his

success is ours, you will wish to grant this request of mine."},{"id":3976,"text":"Please grow accustomed to the idea, therefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All this before I hear a word,\" murmured Amadiro. \"Well, you are a member of the Institute and I will strive to grow accustomed to your personal dream, but now let us have an end to preliminaries and tell me how you intend to destroy Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost automatically, Amadiro made the sign that indicated to his robots that they were not to remember any part of the conversation."},{"id":3977,"text":"And Mandamus, with a small smile, did the same for his.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Let us start then.\" said Mandamus."},{"id":3978,"text":"But before he could speak further, Amadiro moved to the attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure you're not pro-Earth?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus looked startled. \"I am coming to you with a proposal to destroy Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And yet you are a descendant of the Solarian woman in the fifth generation, I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, it is on public record."},{"id":3979,"text":"What of that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Solarian woman is, and has been for a long time, a close associate-friend-protegee-of Fastolfe."},{"id":3980,"text":"I wonder you do not sympathize with his pro-Earth views, therefore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Because of my ancestry?\" Mandamus seemed honestly astonished."},{"id":3981,"text":"For a moment, what might have been a flash of annoyance or even anger seemed to tighten his nostrils, but that vanished and he said quietly, \"An equally longtime close associate- friend-protegee-of your own is Dr."},{"id":3982,"text":"Vasilia Fastolfe, who is Dr."},{"id":3983,"text":"Fastolfe's daughter."},{"id":3984,"text":"She is a descendant in the first generation."},{"id":3985,"text":"I wonder she does not sympathize with his views.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have in the past also wondered,\" said Amadiro, \"but she doesn't sympathize with them and,

Galaxy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then."},{"id":3987,"text":"Go on with the description of your plan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus said, \"I will, but-if you don't mind-from the beginning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Dr."},{"id":3988,"text":"Amadiro, astronomers agree that there are millions of Earthlike planets in our Galaxy, planets on, which human beings can live after necessary adjustments to the environment but without any need for geological terraforming."},{"id":3989,"text":"Their atmospheres are breathable, an ocean of water is present, the land and climate is suitable, life exists."},{"id":3990,"text":"Indeed, the atmospheres would not contain free, oxygen without the presence of ocean plankton at the very least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The land is often barren, but once it and the ocean undergo biological terraforming -that is, once they are seeded with Earth life-such life flourishes and the planet can then be settled."},{"id":3991,"text":"Hundreds of such planets have been recorded and studied and about half of them are already occupied by Settlers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And yet not one habitable planet of all those which have been discovered to date has the enormous variety and excess of life that Earth has."},{"id":3992,"text":"Not one has anything larger or more complex than a small array of wormlike or insect like invertebrates or, in the plant world, anything more advanced than some fernlike shrubbery."},{"id":3993,"text":"No question of intelligence, of anything even approaching intelligence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro listened to the stiff sentences and thought: He's, speaking by rote."},{"id":3994,"text":"He's memorized all this. -He stirred and said, \"I am not a planetologist, Dr."},{"id":3995,"text":"Mandamus, but I ask you to believe that you are telling me nothing I don't already know.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As I said, Dr."},{"id":3996,"text":"Amadiro, I am starting from the beginning. -Astronomers are increasingly of the belief that we have a fair sample of the habitable planets of the Galaxy and that all-or almost all-are markedly different from Earth."},{"id":3997,"text":"For some reason, Earth is a surprisingly unusual Planet and evolution has proceeded on it at a radically rapid pace and m a radically abnormal manner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro said, \"The usual argument is that if there were another intelligent species in the Galaxy that was as advanced as we are, it would have become aware of our expansion by now and have made themselves known to us one way or another.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus said, \"Yes, sir."},{"id":3998,"text":"In fact, if there were another intelligent species in the Galaxy that was -more advanced than we are, we would not have had a chance to expand in the first place."},{"id":3999,"text":"That we are the only species in the Galaxy capable of traveling in hyperspace would seem certain, then."},{"id":4000,"text":"That we are the only species in the Galaxy that is intelligent is perhaps not quite certain, but there is a very good chance that we are.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro was now listening with a weary half-smile."},{"id":4001,"text":"The young man was being didactic, like a man stamping out the rhythm of his monomania in a dull beat."},{"id":4002,"text":"It was one of the marks of the crank and the mild hope Amadiro had had that Mandamus might actually have something that would turn the tide of history was beginning to fade."},{"id":4003,"text":"He said, \"You continue to tell me the known, Dr."},{"id":4004,"text":"Mandamus."},{"id":4005,"text":"Everyone knows Earth seems unique and that we are probably the only intelligent species in the Galaxy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But no one seems to ask the simple question: 'Why?' The Earthpeople and the Settlers don't ask it."},{"id":4006,"text":"They accept it."},{"id":4007,"text":"They have a mystic attitude toward Earth and consider it a holy world, so that its unusual nature is taken as a matter of course."},{"id":4008,"text":"As for the Spacers, we don't ask it."},{"id":4009,"text":"We ignore it."},{"id":4010,"text":"We do our best not to think of Earth at all, since if we do, we are liable to go further and think of ourselves as having descended from Earthpeople.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro said, \"I see no virtue in the question."},{"id":4011,"text":"We need not seek for complex answers to the 'Why?' Random processes play an important role in evolution and, to some extent, in all things."},{"id":4012,"text":"If there are millions of habitable worlds, evolution may proceed on each of them at a different rate."},{"id":4013,"text":"On most, the rate will have some intermediate value; on some the rate will be distinctly slow, on others distinctly fast; on perhaps one it would proceed exceedingly slow and on another exceedingly fast."},{"id":4014,"text":"Earth happens to be the one on which it proceeded exceedingly fast and we are here because of that."},{"id":4015,"text":"Now if we ask 'Why?' the natural-and sufficient- answer is 'Chance.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro waited for the other to betray the crank by exploding in rage at a preeminently logical statement presented in an amused way, that served to shatter his thesis completely."},{"id":4016,"text":"Mandamus, however, merely stared at him for a few moments out of his deep-set eyes and then said quietly, \"NO.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus let that stand for perhaps two beats and then said, \"It takes more than a lucky chance or two to speed evolution a thousand fold."},{"id":4017,"text":"On every planet but Earth, the speed of evolution is closely related to the, flux of cosmic radiation in which that planet is bathed."},{"id":4018,"text":"That speed is not the result of chance at all but the result of cosmic radiation producing mutations at a slow rate."},{"id":4019,"text":"On Earth, something produces many more mutations than are produced on other habitable planets and that has nothing to do with cosmic rays, for they do not strike Earth in any remarkable profusion."},{"id":4020,"text":"Perhaps you see a little more clearly, now, why the 'Why?' could be important.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Dr."},{"id":4021,"text":"Mandamus, since I am still listening, with rather more patience than I would have expected myself to possess, answer the question you so, insistently raise."},{"id":4022,"text":"Or do you merely have the question and no answer?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have an answer,\" said Mandamus, \"and it depends upon the fact that Earth is unique in a second way.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro said, \"Let me anticipate."},{"id":4023,"text":"You are referring to its large satellite."},{"id":4024,"text":"Surely, Dr."},{"id":4025,"text":"Mandamus, you are not advancing this as a discovery Of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Mandamus stiffly, \"but consider that large satellites seem to be common."},{"id":4026,"text":"Our planetary system has five, Earth's has seven and so on."},{"id":4027,"text":"All the known large satellites but one, however, circle gas giants."},{"id":4028,"text":"Only Earth's satellite, the moon, circles a planet not much larger than itself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Dare I use the word 'chance' again, Dr."},{"id":4029,"text":"Mandamus?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In this case, it may be chance, but the moon remains unique.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Even so."},{"id":4030,"text":"What possible connection can the satellite have with Earth's profusion of life?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That may not be obvious and a connection may be unlikely-but it is far more unlikely that two such unusual examples of uniqueness in, a single planet can have no connection at all."},{"id":4031,"text":"I have found such a connection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\" said Amadiro alertly."},{"id":4032,"text":"Now ought to come unmistakable evidence of crackpotism."},{"id":4033,"text":"He looked casually at the time strip on the wall."},{"id":4034,"text":"There really wasn't much more time he could possibly spend on this, for all that his curiosity continued to be aroused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The moon,\" said Mandamus, \"is slowly receding from Earth, due to its tidal effect on the, Earth."},{"id":4035,"text":"Earth's large tides are a unique consequence of the existence of this large satellite."},{"id":4036,"text":"Earth's sun produces tides, too, but to only a third of the extent of the moon's tides-just as our sun produces small tides on Aurora.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Since the moon recedes because of its tidal action, it was far closer to Earth during the early history of its planetary system."},{"id":4037,"text":"The closer the moon to the Earth, the higher the tides on Earth."},{"id":4038,"text":"These tides had two important effects on Earth."},{"id":4039,"text":"It flexed the Earth's crust continually as the Earth rotated and it slowed the Earth's rotation, both through that flexing and through the friction of the ocean's water tides on shallow sea bottoms -so that rotational, energy was converted to heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Earth, therefore, has a thinner crust than any other habitable planet we know of and it is the only habitable planet that displays volcanic action and that has a lively system of plate tectonics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro, said, \"But even all this can have nothing to do with Earth's profusion of life."},{"id":4040,"text":"I think you must either get to the point, Dr."},{"id":4041,"text":"Mandamus, or leave.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Please bear with me, Dr."},{"id":4042,"text":"Amadiro, for just a little while longer."},{"id":4043,"text":"It is important to understand the point once we get to it."},{"id":4044,"text":"I have made a careful computer simulation of the chemical development of Earth's crust, allowing for the effect of tidal action and plate tectonics, something that no one has ever done before in as meticulous and elaborate a way as I have managed to do-if I may praise myself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oh, by all means,\" murmured Amadiro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And it turns out, quite clearly-I will show you all the necessary data at any time you wish-that uranium and thorium collect in Earth's crust and upper mantle in concentrations of up to a thousand times as high as in any other habitable world."},{"id":4045,"text":"Moreover, they collect unevenly, so that scattered over the Earth are occasional pockets where uranium and thorium are even more concentrated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And, I take it, dangerously high in radioactivity?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, Dr."},{"id":4046,"text":"Amadiro."},{"id":4047,"text":"Uranium and thorium are very weakly radioactive and even where they are relatively concentrated, they are not very concentrated in an absolute sense. -All this, I repeat, is because of the presence of a large moon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I assume, then, that the radioactivity, even if not intense enough to be dangerous to life, does suffice to increase the mutation rate."},{"id":4048,"text":"Is that it, Dr."},{"id":4049,"text":"Mandamus?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That is it."},{"id":4050,"text":"There would be more rapid extinctions now and then, but also more rapid development of new species - resulting in an enormous variety and profusion of life-forms."},{"id":4051,"text":"And, eventually, on Earth alone, this would have reached the point of developing an intelligent species and a civilization.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro nodded."},{"id":4052,"text":"The young man was not a crank."},{"id":4053,"text":"He might be wrong, but he was not a crank."},{"id":4054,"text":"And he might be right, too\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro was not a planetologist, so he would have to check books on the subject to see whether Mandamus had perhaps discovered only the already-known, as so many enthusiasts did."},{"id":4055,"text":"There was, however, a more important point he had to check at once."},{"id":4056,"text":"He said in a soft voice, \"You've spoken of the possible destruction of Earth."},{"id":4057,"text":"Is there some connection between that and Earth's unique properties?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One can take advantage of unique properties in a unique manner,\" said Mandamus just as softly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In this particular case-in what way?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Before discussing the method, Dr."},{"id":4058,"text":"Amadiro, I must explain that, in one respect, the question as to whether destruction is physically possible depends on you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On me?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mandamus firmly. \"On you."},{"id":4059,"text":"Why, otherwise, should I come to you with this long story if not to persuade you that I know what I'm talking about, so that you would be willing to cooperate with me in a manner that will be essential to my success?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro drew a long breath. \"And if I refused, would anyone else serve your purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It might be possible for me to turn to others if you refuse."},{"id":4060,"text":"Do you refuse?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not, but I am wondering how essential I am to you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The answer is, not quite as essential as I am to you."},{"id":4061,"text":"You must cooperate with me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Must?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I would like you to-if you prefer it phrased in that fashion."},{"id":4062,"text":"But if you wish Aurora and the Spacers to triumph, now and forever, over Earth and the Settlers, then you must cooperate with me, whether you like the phrase or not.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro said, \"Tell me what it is, exactly, that I must do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Begin by telling me if it is not true that the Institute has, in the past, designed and constructed humanoid robots.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we did."},{"id":4063,"text":"Fifty of them all together."},{"id":4064,"text":"That was between fifteen and twenty decades ago.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That long ago?"},{"id":4065,"text":"And what happened to them?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They failed,\" said Amadiro indifferently."},{"id":4066,"text":"Mandamus sat back in his chair with a horrified expression on his face. \"They were destroyed?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro's eyebrows shot upward. \"Destroyed?"},{"id":4067,"text":"No one destroys expensive robots."},{"id":4068,"text":"They are in storage."},{"id":4069,"text":"The power units are removed and a special long-lived microfusion battery is in each to keep the positronic paths minimally alive.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then they can be brought back to full action?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am sure they can.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus's right hand beat out a tightly controlled rhythm against the arm of the chair."},{"id":4070,"text":"He said grimly, \"Then we can win!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been a long time since Amadiro, had thought of the humanoid robots."},{"id":4071,"text":"It was a painful thought and he had, with some difficulty, trained himself to keep his mind away from that topic."},{"id":4072,"text":"And now Mandamus had unexpectedly brought it up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe humanoid robot had been Fastolfe's great trump card in those long-gone days when Amadiro had been within a millimeter of taking the game, trump card and all."},{"id":4073,"text":"Fastolfe had designed and built two humanoid robots (of which one still existed) and no one else could build any."},{"id":4074,"text":"The entire membership of, the Robotics Institute, working together, could not build them."},{"id":4075,"text":"All that Amadiro had

you want, Dr."},{"id":4117,"text":"Mandamus?\" asked Amadiro."},{"id":4118,"text":"Mandamus looked about, stunned."},{"id":4119,"text":"Finally, he managed to say, \"Incredible!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey stood there, a solid regiment of human beings, with a little more life to them than so many statues might have showed, but with far less life than sleeping human beings would have displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They're standing,\" muttered Mandamus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They take up less room that way."},{"id":4120,"text":"Obviously.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But they've been standing about fifteen decades."},{"id":4121,"text":"They can't still be in working order."},{"id":4122,"text":"Surely their joints are frozen, their organs broken down.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro shrugged. \"Perhaps."},{"id":4123,"text":"Still, if the joints have deteriorated -and that isn't out of the question, I suppose those can be replaced-if necessary."},{"id":4124,"text":"It would depend on whether there would be reason to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There would be reason,\" said Mandamus."},{"id":4125,"text":"He looked from head to head."},{"id":4126,"text":"They were staring in slightly different directions and that gave them a somewhat unsettling appearance, as though they were on the point of breaking ranks."},{"id":4127,"text":"Mandamus said, \"Each has an individual appearance and they differ in height, build, and so on.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes."},{"id":4128,"text":"Does that surprise you?"},{"id":4129,"text":"We were planning to have these, along with others we might have built, be the pioneers in the development of new worlds."},{"id":4130,"text":"To have them do so properly, we wanted them to be as human as possible, which meant making them as individual as Aurorans are."},{"id":4131,"text":"Doesn't that seem sensible to you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely."},{"id":4132,"text":"I'm glad this is so."},{"id":4133,"text":"I've read all I can about the two protohumaniforms that Fastolfe himself built Daneel Olivaw and Jander Panell."},{"id":4134,"text":"I've seen holographs of them and they seemed identical.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Amadiro impatiently. \"Not only identical, but each virtually a caricature of one's conception of the ideal Spacer."},{"id":4135,"text":"That was Fastolfe's romanticism."},{"id":4136,"text":"I'm sure that he would have built a race of interchangeable humanoid robots, with both sexes possessing such ethereal good looks-or what he considered to be that-as to make them completely inhuman."},{"id":4137,"text":"Fastolfe may be a brilliant roboticist, but he is an incredibly stupid man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro shook his head."},{"id":4138,"text":"To have been beaten by such an incredibly stupid man, he thought-and then he thrust the thought away."},{"id":4139,"text":"He had not been beaten by Fastolfe, but by that infernal Earthman."},{"id":4140,"text":"Lost in thought, he did not hear Mandamus's next question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" he said with an edge of irritation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I said, 'Did you design these, Dr."},{"id":4141,"text":"Amadiro?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, by an odd coincidence-and one that strikes me as possessing a peculiar irony-these were designed by Fastolfe's daughter Vasilia."},{"id":4142,"text":"She's as brilliant as he is and much more intelligent- which may be one reason why they never got along.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As I have heard the story concerning them-,\" began Mandamus."},{"id":4143,"text":"Amadiro waved him into silence. \"I have heard the story, too, but it doesn't matter."},{"id":4144,"text":"It's enough that she does her work very well and that there is no danger that she will ever find herself in sympathy with someone who, despite the accident that he is her biological father, is-and must remain forever alien and hateful to her."},{"id":4145,"text":"She even calls herself Vasilia Aliena, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know."},{"id":4146,"text":"Do you have the brain patterns of these humanoid robots on record?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For each of these?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And can they be made available to me?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If there's a reason for it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There will be,\" said Mandwnus funnily. \"Since these robots were designed for pioneering activities, may I assume they are equipped to explore a world and deal with primitive conditions?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That should be self-evident.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That's perfect-but there may have to be some modifications."},{"id":4147,"text":"Do you suppose that Vasilia Fast-Aliena would be able to help me with that-if necessary?"},{"id":4148,"text":"Obviously, she would be best-acquainted with the brain patterns.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Obviously."},{"id":4149,"text":"Still, I don't know whether she would be willing to help you."},{"id":4150,"text":"I do know that it is physically impossible for her to do so at the moment, since she is not on Aurora.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus looked surprised and displeased. \"Where is she, then, Dr."},{"id":4151,"text":"Amadiro?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro said, \"You have seen these humaniforms and I do not wish to expose myself to these rather dismal surroundings."},{"id":4152,"text":"You have kept me waiting long enough and you must not complain if I keep you waiting now."},{"id":4153,"text":"If you have any further questions, let us deal with them in my office.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce in the office, Amadiro delayed things a while longer. \"Wait here for me,\" he said rather peremptorily and left."},{"id":4154,"text":"Mandamus waited stiffly, sorting out his thoughts, wondering when Amadiro would return-or if he would."},{"id":4155,"text":"Was he to be arrested or simply ejected?"},{"id":4156,"text":"Had Amadiro grown tired of waiting for the point?"},{"id":4157,"text":"Mandamus refused to believe that."},{"id":4158,"text":"He had gained a shrewd idea of Amadiro's desperate desire for evening an old score."},{"id":4159,"text":"It seemed evident that Amadiro wouldn't get tired of listening as long as there seemed the slightest chance that Mandamus would make revenge possible."},{"id":4160,"text":"As he looked idly about - Amadiro's office, Mandamus found himself wondering whether there might be any information that might be of help to him in the computerized files almost immediately at hand."},{"id":4161,"text":"It would be useful not to have to depend directly on Amadiro for everything."},{"id":4162,"text":"The thought was a useless one."},{"id":4163,"text":"Mandamus did not know the entry code for the files and, even if he did, there were several of Amadiro's personal robots standing in their niches and they would stop him if he took a single step toward anything that was labeled in their minds as sensitive."},{"id":4164,"text":"Even his own robots would."},{"id":4165,"text":"Amadiro, was right."},{"id":4166,"text":"Robots were so useful and efficient-and incorruptible- as guards that the very concept of anything criminal, illegal, or simply underhanded did not occur to anyone."},{"id":4167,"text":"The tendency just atrophied-at least as against other Spacers."},{"id":4168,"text":"He wondered how Settlers could manage without robots."},{"id":4169,"text":"Mandamus tried to imagine human personalities clashing, with no robotic bumpers to cushion the interaction, no robotic presence to give them a decent sense of security and to enforce-without their being consciously aware of it most of the time-a proper mode of morality."},{"id":4170,"text":"It would be impossible for Settlers to be anything but barbarians under the circumstance and the Galaxy could not be left to them."},{"id":4171,"text":"Amadiro was right in that respect and had always been right, while Fastolfe was fantastically wrong."},{"id":4172,"text":"Mandamus nodded, as though he had once again persuaded himself as to the correctness of what he was planning."},{"id":4173,"text":"He sighed and wished it were not necessary, then prepared to go over, once again, the line of reasoning that proved to him that it was necessary, when Amadiro strode in."},{"id":4174,"text":"Amadiro was still an impressive figure, even though he was within a year of his twenty-eighth decade-day."},{"id":4175,"text":"He was very much what a Spacer ought to look like, except for the unfortunate shapelessness of his nose."},{"id":4176,"text":"Amadiro said, \"I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, but there was business I had to attend to."},{"id":4177,"text":"I am the head of this Institute and that entails responsibilities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus said, \"Could you tell me where Dr."},{"id":4178,"text":"Vasilia Aliena is?"},{"id":4179,"text":"I will then describe my project to you without delay.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Vasilia is on tour."},{"id":4180,"text":"She's visiting each of the Spacer worlds to find out where they stand on robot research."},{"id":4181,"text":"She appears to think that, since the Robot Institute was founded to coordinate individual research on Aurora, interplanetary coordination would I advance the cause even farther."},{"id":4182,"text":"A good idea, actually.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus laughed, shortly and without humor. \"They won't tell her anything."},{"id":4183,"text":"I doubt any Spacer world wants to hand Aurora a more enormous lead than she already has.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Don't be too sure."},{"id":4184,"text":"The Settler situation has disturbed us all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do you know where she is now?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We have her itinerary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Get her back, Dr."},{"id":4185,"text":"Amadiro.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro frowned. \"I doubt I can do that easily."},{"id":4186,"text":"I believe she wants to be away from Aurora until her father dies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Mandamus in surprise."},{"id":4187,"text":"Amadiro shrugged. \"I don't know."},{"id":4188,"text":"I don't care. -But what I do know is that your time has run out."},{"id":4189,"text":"Do you understand?"},{"id":4190,"text":"Get to the point or leave.\" He pointed to the door grimly and Mandamus felt that the other's patience would stretch no farther."},{"id":4191,"text":"Mandamus said, \"Very well."},{"id":4192,"text":"There is yet a third way in which Earth is unique.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe talked easily and with due economy, as though he were going through an exposition that he had frequently rehearsed and polished for the very purpose of presenting it to Amadiro."},{"id":4193,"text":"And Amadiro found himself increasingly absorbed."},{"id":4194,"text":"That was it!"},{"id":4195,"text":"Amadiro first felt a huge sense of relief."},{"id":4196,"text":"He had been correct to gamble on the young man's not being a crackpot."},{"id":4197,"text":"He was entirely sane."},{"id":4198,"text":"Then came triumph."},{"id":4199,"text":"It would surely work."},{"id":4200,"text":"Of course, the young man's view, as it was expounded, veered a bit from the path Amadiro felt it ought to follow, but that could be taken care of eventually."},{"id":4201,"text":"Modifications were always possible."},{"id":4202,"text":"And when Mandamus was done, Amadiro said in a voice he strove to hold steady, \"We won't need Vasilia."},{"id":4203,"text":"There is appropriate expertise at the Institute to allow us to begin at once."},{"id":4204,"text":"Dr."},{"id":4205,"text":"Mandamus -a note of formal respect entered Amadiro's voice-\"let this thing work out as planned and I cannot help but think it will-and you will be the head of the Institute when I am Chairman of the Council.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus smiled narrowly and briefly, while Amadiro sat back in his chair and, just as briefly, allowed himself to look into the future with satisfaction and confidence, something he had not been able to do for twenty long and weary decades."},{"id":4206,"text":"How long would it take?"},{"id":4207,"text":"Decades?"},{"id":4208,"text":"One decade?"},{"id":4209,"text":"Part of a decade?"},{"id":4210,"text":"Not long."},{"id":4211,"text":"Not long."},{"id":4212,"text":"It must be hastened by all means so that he could live to see that old decision overturned and himself lord of Aurora-and therefore of the Spacer worlds-and therefore (with Earth and the Settler worlds doomed) even lord of the Galaxy before he died."},{"id":4213,"text":"When Dr."},{"id":4214,"text":"Han Fastolfe died, seven years after Amadiro and Mandamus met and began their project, the hyperwave carried the news with explosive force to every comer of the occupied worlds."},{"id":4215,"text":"It merited the greatest attention everywhere."},{"id":4216,"text":"In the Spacer worlds it was important because Fastolfe had been the most powerful man on Aurora and, therefore, in the Galaxy for over twenty decades."},{"id":4217,"text":"In the Settler worlds and on Earth, it was important because Fastolfe had been a friend insofar as a Spacer could be a friend-and the question now was whether Spacer policy would change and, if so, how."},{"id":4218,"text":"The news came also to Vasilia Aliena and it was complicated by the bitterness that had tinged her relationship with her biological father almost from the beginning."},{"id":4219,"text":"She had schooled herself to feel nothing when he died, yet she had not wanted to be on the same world that he was on at the time the event took place."},{"id":4220,"text":"She did not want the questions that would be leveled at her anywhere, but most frequently and insistently on Aurora."},{"id":4221,"text":"The parent-child relationship among the Spacers was a weak and indifferent one at best."},{"id":4222,"text":"With long lives, that was a matter of course."},{"id":4223,"text":"Nor would anyone have been interested in Vasilia in that respect, but for the fact that Fastolfe was so continually prominent a party leader and Vasilia almost as prominent a partisan on the other side."},{"id":4224,"text":"It was poisonous."},{"id":4225,"text":"She had gone to the trouble of making Vasilia Aliena her legal name and of using it on all documents, in all interviews, in all dealings of any kind-and yet she knew for a fact that most people thought of her as Vasilia Fastolfe."},{"id":4226,"text":"It was as though nothing could wipe out that thoroughly meaningless relationship, so that she was reduced to having to be content with being addressed by her first name only."},{"id":4227,"text":"It-was, at least, an uncommon name."},{"id":4228,"text":"And that, too, seemed to emphasize her mirror-image relationship with the Solarian woman who, for thoroughly independent reasons, had denied her first husband as Vasilia had denied her father."},{"id":4229,"text":"The Solarian woman, too, could not live with the early surnames fastened upon her and ended with a first name only-Gladia."},{"id":4230,"text":"Vasilia and Gladia, misfits, deniers- They even resembled each other."},{"id":4231,"text":"Vasilia stole a look at the mirror hanging in her spaceship cabin."},{"id":4232,"text":"She had not seen Gladia in many decades, but she was sure that the resemblance remained."},{"id":4233,"text":"They were both small and slim."},{"id":4234,"text":"Both were blond and their faces were somewhat alike."},{"id":4235,"text":"But it was Vasilia who always, lost and Gladia who always won."},{"id":4236,"text":"When Vasilia had left her father and had struck him from her life, he had found Gladia instead-and she was the pliant and passive daughter he wanted, the daughter that Vasilia could never be."},{"id":4237,"text":"Nevertheless, it embittered Vasilia."},{"id":4238,"text":"She herself was a roboticist; as competent and as skillful, at last, as ever Fastolfe had been, while Gladia was merely an artist, who amused herself with force-field coloring and with the illusions of robotic clothing."},{"id":4239,"text":"How could Fastolfe have been satisfied to lose the one and gain, in her place, nothing more than the other?"},{"id":4240,"text":"And when that policeman from Earth, Elijah Baley, had come to Aurora, he had bullied Vasilia into revealing far more of her thoughts and feelings than she had ever granted anyone else."},{"id":4241,"text":"He was, however, softness itself to Gladia and had helped her-and her protector, Fastolfe-win out against all the odds, though to this day Vasilia had not been able to understand clearly how that had happened."},{"id":4242,"text":"It was Gladia who had been at Fastolfe's bedside during the final illness, who had held his hand to the end, and who had heard his last words."},{"id":4243,"text":"Why Vasilia should resent that, she didn't know, for she herself would, under no circumstances, have acknowledged the old man's existence to the extent of visiting him to witness his passage into nonexistence in an absolute, rather than a subjective sense-and yet she raged against Gladia's presence."},{"id":4244,"text":"It's the way I feel, she told herself defiantly, and I owe no one an explanation."},{"id":4245,"text":"And she had lost Giskard."},{"id":4246,"text":"Giskard had been her robot, Vasilia's own robot when she had been a young girl, the robot granted her by a then seemingly fond father."},{"id":4247,"text":"It was Giskard through whom she had learned robotics and from whom she had felt the first genuine affection."},{"id":4248,"text":"She had not as a child, speculated on the Three Laws or dealt with the philosophy of positronic automatism."},{"id":4249,"text":"Giskard had seemed affectionate, he had acted as though he were affectionate, and that was enough for a child."},{"id":4250,"text":"She had never found such affection in any human being-certainly not her father."},{"id":4251,"text":"To this day, she had yet to be weak enough to play the foolish love game with anyone."},{"id":4252,"text":"Her bitterness over her loss of Giskard had taught her that any initial gain was not worth the final deprivation."},{"id":4253,"text":"When she had left home, disowning her father, he would not let Giskard go with her, even though she herself had improved Giskard immeasurably in the course of her careful reprogramming of him."},{"id":4254,"text":"And when her father had died, he had left Giskard to the Solarian woman."},{"id":4255,"text":"He had also left her Paneel, but Vasilia cared nothing for that pale imitation of a man."},{"id":4256,"text":"She wanted Giskard, who was her own."},{"id":4257,"text":"Vasilia was on her way back to Solaria now."},{"id":4258,"text":"Her tour was quite done."},{"id":4259,"text":"In fact, as far as usefulness was concerned, it had been essentially over months ago."},{"id":4260,"text":"But she had remained on Hesperos for a needed rest, as she had explained in her official notice to the Institute."},{"id":4261,"text":"Now, however, Fastolfe was dead and she could return."},{"id":4262,"text":"And while she could not undo the past entirely, she could undo part of it."},{"id":4263,"text":"Giskard must be hers again."},{"id":4264,"text":"She was determined on that."},{"id":4265,"text":"Amadiro was quite ambivalent in his response to Vasilia's return."},{"id":4266,"text":"She had not come back until old Fastolfe (he could say the name to himself quite easily now that he was dead) was a month in his um."},{"id":4267,"text":"That flattered his opinion of his own understanding."},{"id":4268,"text":"After all, he had told Mandamus her motive had been that of remaining away from Aurora till her father died."},{"id":4269,"text":"Then, too, Vasilia was comfortably transparent."},{"id":4270,"text":"She lacked the exasperating quality of Mandamus, his new favorite, who always seemed to have yet another unexpressed thought tucked away -no matter how thoroughly he seemed to have discharged the contents of his mind."},{"id":4271,"text":"On the other hand, she was irritatingly hard to control the least likely to go quietly along the path he indicated."},{"id":4272,"text":"Leave it to her to probe the otherworld Spacers to the bone during the years she had spent away from Aurora-but then leave it also to her to interpret it all in dark and riddling words."},{"id":4273,"text":"So he greeted her with an enthusiasm that was somewhere between feigned and unfeigned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Vasilia, I'm so happy to have you back."},{"id":4274,"text":"The Institute flies on one wing when you're gone.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia laughed. \"Come, Kelden\"- she alone had no hesitation or inhibition in using his given name, though she was two and a half decades younger than he-----\"that one remaining wing is yours and how long has it been now since you ceased being perfectly certain that your one wing was sufficient?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Since you decided to stretch out your absence to years."},{"id":4275,"text":"Do you find Aurora much changed in the interval?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit- which ought perhaps to be a concern of ours."},{"id":4276,"text":"Changelessness is decay.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A paradox."},{"id":4277,"text":"There is no decay without a change for the worse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Changelessness is a change for the worse, Kelden, in comparison to the surrounding Settler worlds."},{"id":4278,"text":"They change rapidly, extending their control into more numerous worlds and over each individual world more thoroughly."},{"id":4279,"text":"They increase their strength and power and self-assurance, while we sit here dreaming and find our unchanging might diminishing steadily in comparison.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful, Vasilia!"},{"id":4280,"text":"I think you memorized that carefully on your flight here."},{"id":4281,"text":"However, there, has been a change in the political situation on Aurora.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You mean my biological father is dead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro spread his arms with a little \"bow of his head. \"As you say."},{"id":4282,"text":"He was largely responsible for our paralysis and he is gone, so I imagine there will now be change, though it may not necessarily be visible change.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You keep secrets from me, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Would I do that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Certainly."},{"id":4283,"text":"That false smile of yours gives you away every time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then I must learn to be grave with you. --Come, I have your report."},{"id":4284,"text":"Tell me what is not included in it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Allis included in it-almost."},{"id":4285,"text":"Each, Spacer world states vehemently that it is disturbed by growing Settler arrogance."},{"id":4286,"text":"Each is firmly determined to resist the Settlers to the end, enthusiastically following the Auroran lead with vigor and death-defying gallantry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Follow our lead, yes."},{"id":4287,"text":"And if we don't lead?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then they'll wait and try to mask their relief that we are not leading."},{"id":4288,"text":"Otherwise-Well, each one is engaged in technological advance and each one is reluctant to reveal what it is, exactly, that it is doing."},{"id":4289,"text":"Each is working independently and is not even unified within its own globe."},{"id":4290,"text":"There is not a single research team anywhere on any of the Spacer worlds that resembles our own Robotics Institute."},{"id":4291,"text":"Each world consists of individual researchers, each of whom diligently guards his own data from all the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro was almost complacent as he said, \"I would not expect them to have advanced as far as we have.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Too bad they haven't,\" replied Vasilia, tartly. \"With all the Spacer worlds a jumble of individuals, progress is too slow."},{"id":4292,"text":"The Settler worlds meet regularly at conventions, have their institutes-and though they lag well behind us, they will catch up.----Still, I've managed to uncover a few technological advances being worked on by the Spacer worlds and I have them all listed in my report., They are all working on I the nuclear intensifier, for instance, but I don't believe that such a device has passed beyond the laboratory demonstration level on a single world."},{"id":4293,"text":"Something that would be practical on shipboard is not yet here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I hope you are right in that, Vasilia."},{"id":4294,"text":"The nuclear intensifier is a weapon our fleets could use, for it would finish the Settlers at once."},{"id":4295,"text":"However, I think, on the whole, it would be better if Aurora had the weapon ahead of our Spacer brothers. -But you said that all was included in your report-almost."},{"id":4296,"text":"I heard that 'almost.' What is not included, then?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Solaria!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ah, the youngest and most peculiar of the Spacer worlds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I got almost nothing directly out of them."},{"id":4297,"text":"They viewed me with absolute hostility as, I believe, they would have viewed any non-Solarian, whether Spacer or Settler."},{"id":4298,"text":"And when I say 'viewed,' I mean that in their sense."},{"id":4299,"text":"I remained nearly a year on the world, a considerably longer time than I spent on any other world, and in all those months I never saw a single Solarian face-to-face."},{"id":4300,"text":"In every case, I viewed him-or her-by hyperwave hologram."},{"id":4301,"text":"I could never deal with anything tangible-images only."},{"id":4302,"text":"The world was comfortable, incredibly luxurious, in fact, and for a nature lover, totally unspoiled, but how I missed seeing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, viewing is a Solarian custom.- We all know that, Vasilia."},{"id":4303,"text":"Live and let live.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Humph,\" said Vasilia. \"Your tolerance may be misplaced."},{"id":4304,"text":"Are your robots in the nonrepeat mode?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are."},{"id":4305,"text":"And I assure you we are not being eavesdropped upon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I hope not, Kelden. -I am under the distinct impression that the Solarians are closer to developing a miniaturized nuclear intensifier than any other world-than we are."},{"id":4306,"text":"They may be close to making one that's portable and that's possessed of a power consumption small enough to make it practical for space vessels.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro frowned deeply. \"How do they manage that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say."},{"id":4307,"text":"You don't suppose they showed me blueprints, do you?"},{"id":4308,"text":"My impressions are so inchoate I dared not put them in the report, but from small things I heard here or observed there-I think they are making important progress."},{"id":4309,"text":"This is something we should think about carefully.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We will. -Is there anything else you would like to tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes-and also not in the report."},{"id":4310,"text":"Solaria has been working toward humanoid robots for many decades and I think they have achieved that goal."},{"id":4311,"text":"No other Spacer would outside of ourselves, of course-has even attempted the matter."},{"id":4312,"text":"When I asked, on each world, what they were doing with respect to humanoid robots, the reaction was uniform."},{"id":4313,"text":"They found the very concept unpleasant and horrifying."},{"id":4314,"text":"I suspect they all noticed our failure and took it to heart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But not Solaria?"},{"id":4315,"text":"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For one thing, they, have always lived in the most extremely robotized society in the Galaxy."},{"id":4316,"text":"They're surrounded by robots-ten thousand per individual."},{"id":4317,"text":"The world is saturated with--them."},{"id":4318,"text":"If you were to wander through it aimlessly, searching for humans, you would find nothing."},{"id":4319,"text":"So why should the few Solarians, living in such a world, be upset by the thought of a few more robots just because they're humaniform?"},{"id":4320,"text":"Then, too, that pseudo-human wretch that Fastolfe designed and built and that still exists--.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Daneel,\" said Amadiro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that one."},{"id":4321,"text":"He--it was on Solaria twenty decades ago and the Solarians treated it as human."},{"id":4322,"text":"They have never recovered from that."},{"id":4323,"text":"Even if they had no use for humaniforms, they were humiliated at having been deceived."},{"id":4324,"text":"It was an unforgettable demonstration that Aurora was -far ahead of them in that one facet of robotics, at any rate."},{"id":4325,"text":"The Solarians take inordinate pride in being the most advanced roboticists in the Galaxy and, ever since, individual Solarians have been working on humaniforms-if for no other reason than to wipe out that disgrace."},{"id":4326,"text":"If they had had greater numbers or an institute that could coordinate their work, they would undoubtedly have come up with some long, ago."},{"id":4327,"text":"As it is, I think they have them now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You don't really know, do you?"},{"id":4328,"text":"This is just suspicion based on scraps of data here and there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Exactly right, but it's a fairly strong suspicion and it merits further investigation. -And a third point."},{"id":4329,"text":"I could swear they were working on telepathic communication."},{"id":4330,"text":"There was some equipment that I was incautiously allowed to see."},{"id":4331,"text":"And once when I had one of their roboticists on view the hyperwave screen showed a blackboard with a positronic pattern matrix that was like nothing I ever remember seeing, yet it seemed to me that pattern might fit a telepathic program\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I suspect, Vasilia, that this item is woven of even airier gossamer than the bit about the humanoid robots.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA look of mild embarrassment crossed Vasilia's face. \"I must admit you're probably right there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In fact, Vasilia, it sounds like mere fantasy."},{"id":4332,"text":"If the pattern matrix you saw was like nothing you remember ever having seen before, how could you think it would fit, anything?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia hesitated. \"To tell you the truth, I've been wondering about that myself."},{"id":4333,"text":"Yet when I saw the pattern, the word 'telepathy' occurred to me at once.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Even though telepathy is impossible, even in theory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is thought to be impossible, even in theory."},{"id":4334,"text":"That is not quite the same thing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No one has ever been able to make any progress toward it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but why should I have looked at that pattern and thought 'telepathy'?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ah well, Vasilia, there may be a, personal psychoquirk there that is useless to try to analyze."},{"id":4335,"text":"I'd forget it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Anything else?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One more thing-and the most puzzling of all."},{"id":4336,"text":"I gathered the impression, Kelden, from one little indication or another, that the Solarians, are planning to leave their planet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I don't know."},{"id":4337,"text":"Their population, small as it is, is declining further."},{"id":4338,"text":"Perhaps they want to make a new start elsewhere before they die out altogether.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What kind of new start?"},{"id":4339,"text":"Where would they go?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia shook her head. \"I have told you all I know.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro said slowly, \"Well, then, I will take all this into account."},{"id":4340,"text":"Four things: nuclear intensifier, humanoid robots telepathic robots, and abandoning the planet."},{"id":4341,"text":"Frankly, I have no faith in any of the four, but I'll persuade the Council to authorize talks with the Solarian regent. -And now, Vasilia, I believe you could use a rest, so why not take a few weeks off and grow accustomed to the Auroran sun and fine weather before getting back to work?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That is kind of you, Kelden,\" said Vasilia- remaining firmly seated, \"but there remain two items I must bring up.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily, Amadiro's eyes sought the time strip. \"This won't take up very much time, will it, Vasilia?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"However much time it takes, Kelden, is what it will take up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What is it you want then?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To begin with, who is this young know-it-all who seems to think he is running, the Institute, this what's-his-name, Mandamus?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You've met him, have you?\" said Amadiro, his smile masking a certain uneasiness. \"You see, things do change on Aurora.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not for the better in this case,\" said Vasilia grimly. \"Who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He is exactly what you have described-a know-it-all."},{"id":4342,"text":"He is a brilliant young man, bright enough in robotics, but, just as knowledgeable in general physics\" in chemistry, in planetology----.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And how old is this monster of erudition?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not quite five decades.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And what will this child be when he grows up?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Wise as well as brilliant, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Don't pretend to mistake my meaning, Kelden."},{"id":4343,"text":"Are you thinking of grooming him as the next head of the Institute?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I intend to live for a good many decades yet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That is no answer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is the only answer I have.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia shifted in her seat restlessly and her robot, standing behind her, sent his eyes from side to side as though preparing to ward off an attack-pushed into that mode of behavior, perhaps, by Vasilia's uneasiness."},{"id":4344,"text":"Vasilia said, \"Kelden, I am to be the next head."},{"id":4345,"text":"That is settled."},{"id":4346,"text":"You have told me so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have, but in actual fact, Vasilia, once I die, the Board of Directors will make the choice."},{"id":4347,"text":"Even if I leave behind me a directive as to who the next head will be, the Board can reverse me."},{"id":4348,"text":"That much is clear in the terms of incorporation that founded the Institute.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You just write your directive, Kelden, and I will take care of the Board of Directors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Amadiro, the space between his eyebrows furrowing said, \"This is not something I will discuss any further at this moment."},{"id":4349,"text":"What is the other item you want to bring up?"},{"id":4350,"text":"Please make it brief.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe stared at him in silent anger for a moment, then said, seeming to bite off the word, \"Giskard!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The robot?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Of course the robot."},{"id":4351,"text":"Do you know any other Giskard that I am likely to be talking about?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, what of him?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He is mine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro looked surprised. \"He is-or was-the legal property of Fastolfe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Giskard was mine when I was a child.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Fastolfe lent him to you and eventually took him back."},{"id":4352,"text":"There was no formal transfer of ownership, was there?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Morally, he was mine."},{"id":4353,"text":"But in any case, Fastolfe owns him no longer."},{"id":4354,"text":"He is dead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He made a will, too."},{"id":4355,"text":"And if I remember correctly, by that will, two robots--Giskard and Daneel-are now the property of the Solarian woman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But I don't want them to be."},{"id":4356,"text":"I am Fastolfe's daughter----.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oil?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia flushed. \"I have a claim to Giskard."},{"id":4357,"text":"Why should a stranger-an alien-have him?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For one thing, because Fastolfe willed it so."},{"id":4358,"text":"And she's an Auroran citizen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Who says so?"},{"id":4359,"text":"To every Auroran she is 'the Solarian woman.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro brought his fist down on the arm of his chair in a sudden spilling over of fury. \"Vasilia, what is it you wish of me?"},{"id":4360,"text":"I have no liking for the Solarian woman."},{"id":4361,"text":"I have, in fact, a profound dislike of her and, if there were a way, I would\" -he looked briefly at the robots, as though unwilling to unsettle them -\"get her off the planet."},{"id":4362,"text":"But I can't upset the will."},{"id":4363,"text":"Even if there were a legal way to do so-and there isn't-it wouldn't be wise to do it."},{"id":4364,"text":"Fastolfe is dead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Precisely the reason Giskard should be mine now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro ignored her. \"And the coalition he headed is falling apart."},{"id":4365,"text":"It was held together in the last few decades only by his personal charisma."},{"id":4366,"text":"Now what I would like to do is to pick up fragments of that coalition and add it to my own following."},{"id":4367,"text":"In that way, I may put a group together that would be strong enough to dominate the Council and win control in the coming elections.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With you becoming the next Chairman?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why not?"},{"id":4368,"text":"Aurora could do worse, for it would give me a chance to reverse our longtime policy of built-in disaster before it is too late."},{"id":4369,"text":"The trouble is that I don't have Fastolfe's personal popularity."},{"id":4370,"text":"I don't have his gift of exuding saintliness as a cover for stupidity."},{"id":4371,"text":"Consequently, if I seem to be triumphing in an unfair and petty way over a dead man, it will not look good."},{"id":4372,"text":"No one must say that, having been defeated by Fastolfe while he was alive, I overturned his will out of trivial spite after he was dead."},{"id":4373,"text":"I won't have anything as ridiculous as that standing in the way of the great life-and death decisions Aurora must make."},{"id":4374,"text":"Do you understand me?"},{"id":4375,"text":"You'll have to do without Giskard!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia arose, body stiff, eyes narrow. \"We'll see about that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We have already seen."},{"id":4376,"text":"This meeting is over and if you have any ambitions to be the head of the Institute, I don't ever want to see you threatening me about anything."},{"id":4377,"text":"So if you're going to make a threat now, of any kind at all, I advise you to reconsider.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I make no threats,\" said Vasilia, every ounce of body language contradicting her words-and she left with a sweep, beckoning her robot, unnecessarily, to follow."},{"id":4378,"text":"The emergency-or rather, the series of emergencies began some months later when Maloon Cicis entered Amadiro's office for the usual morning conference."},{"id":4379,"text":"Ordinarily, Amadiro looked forward to that."},{"id":4380,"text":"Cicis was always a restful interlude in the course of the busy day."},{"id":4381,"text":"He was, the one senior member of the Institute who had no ambitions and who was not calculating against the day of Amadiro's death or retirement."},{"id":4382,"text":"Cicis was, in fact, the perfect subordinate."},{"id":4383,"text":"He was happy to be of service and delighted to be in Amadiro's confidence."},{"id":4384,"text":"For this reason, Amadiro had been disturbed, in the last year or so, at the flavor of decay, the slight concavity of the chest, the touch of stiffness in the walk of his perfect subordinate."},{"id":4385,"text":"Could Cicis be getting old?"},{"id":4386,"text":"Surely he was only a few decades older than Amadiro."},{"id":4387,"text":"It struck Amadiro most unpleasantly that perhaps along with the gradual degeneration of so many facets of Spacer life, the life expectancy was falling."},{"id":4388,"text":"He meant to look up the statistics, but kept forgetting to do so--or was unconsciously afraid of doing so."},{"id":4389,"text":"On this occasion, though, the appearance of age in Cicis was drowned in violent emotion."},{"id":4390,"text":"His face was red (pointing up the graying of his bronze hair) and he appeared virtually exploding with astonishment."},{"id":4391,"text":"Amadiro did not have to inquire as to the news."},{"id":4392,"text":"Cicis delivered it as though it was something he could not contain."},{"id":4393,"text":"When he finished exploding, Amadiro said, stupefied, \"All radio-wave emissions ceased?"},{"id":4394,"text":"All?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All, Chief."},{"id":4395,"text":"They must all be dead-or gone."},{"id":4396,"text":"No inhabited world can avoid emitting some electromagnetic radiation at our level of-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro waved him silent."},{"id":4397,"text":"One of Vasilia's points-the fourth, as he recalled-had been that the Solarians were preparing to leave their world."},{"id":4398,"text":"It had been a nonsensical suggestion; all four had been more or less nonsensical."},{"id":4399,"text":"He had said he would keep it in mind and, of course, he hadn't."},{"id":4400,"text":"Now, apparently, that had proved to be a mistake."},{"id":4401,"text":"What had made it seem nonsensical when Vasilia had advanced the notion still made it seem nonsensical."},{"id":4402,"text":"He asked the question now that he had asked then, even though he expected no answer. (What answer could there be?) \"Where in Space could they go, Maloon?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There's no word on that, Chief.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, when did they go?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There's no word on that, either."},{"id":4403,"text":"We got the news this morning."},{"id":4404,"text":"The trouble is the radiational intensity is so low on Solaria anyway."},{"id":4405,"text":"It's very sparsely inhabited and its robots are well-shielded."},{"id":4406,"text":"The intensity is an order of magnitude lower than that of any other Spacer world; two orders lower than ours\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So one day someone noticed that what was very small had actually declined to zero, but no one actually caught it as it was declining."},{"id":4407,"text":"Who noticed it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A Nexonian ship Chief.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The ship was being forced into orbit about Solaria's sun in order to carry through emergency repairs."},{"id":4408,"text":"They hyperwaved for permission and got no answer."},{"id":4409,"text":"They had no choice but to disregard that, continue into orbit, and carry through their repairs."},{"id":4410,"text":"They were, not interfered with in any way in that time."},{"id":4411,"text":"It was not till after they had left that, in checking through their records, they found that not only had they gotten no answer, but that they had gotten no radiational signal of any kind."},{"id":4412,"text":"There's no way of telling exactly when radiation had ceased."},{"id":4413,"text":"The last recorded receipt of any message from Solaria was over two months ago.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And the other three points she made?\" Amadiro muttered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Chief?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nothing."},{"id":4414,"text":"Nothing,\" said Amadiro, but he frowned heavily and was lost in thought."},{"id":4415,"text":"Mandamus was not aware of developments on Solaria when he returned some months later from an extended third trip to Earth."},{"id":4416,"text":"On his first trip, six years before, Amadiro had managed, with some difficulty, to have him sent as an accredited emissary from Aurora to discuss some trifling matter of an overstepping into Spacer territory by Trader vessels."},{"id":4417,"text":"He had endured the ceremony and bureaucratic ennui and it quickly became clear that as such an emissary his mobility was limited."},{"id":4418,"text":"That didn't matter, for he learned what he had come to learn."},{"id":4419,"text":"He had returned with the news. \"I doubt, Dr."},{"id":4420,"text":"Amadiro that there will be any problem at all."},{"id":4421,"text":"There is no way, no possible way, in which the Earth officials can control either entry or exit."},{"id":4422,"text":"Every year many millions of Settlers visit Earth from any of dozens of worlds and every year as, many millions of visiting Settlers leave for home again."},{"id":4423,"text":"Every Settler seems to feel that life is not complete unless he or she periodically breathes the air of Earth and treads its crowded underground spaces."},{"id":4424,"text":"It's a search for roots, I imagine."},{"id":4425,"text":"They don't seem to feel the absolute nightmare that, existence on Earth is.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I know about it, Mandamus,\" said Amadiro wearily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Only intellectually, sir."},{"id":4426,"text":"You can't truly understand it until you experience it."},{"id":4427,"text":"Once you do, you'll find that none of your 'knowing' will prepare you in the least for the reality."},{"id":4428,"text":"Why anyone should want to go back, once gone-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Our ancestors certainly didn't want to go back, once they had left the planet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mandamus, \"but interstellar flight was not then as advanced as it is now."},{"id":4429,"text":"It used to take months then and the hyperspatial Jump was a tricky thing."},{"id":4430,"text":"Now it takes merely days and the Jumps are routine and never go wrong."},{"id":4431,"text":"If it were as easy to return to Earth in our ancestors time as it is now, I wonder if we would have broken away as we did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Let's not philosophize, Mandamus."},{"id":4432,"text":"Proceed to the point.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Certainly."},{"id":4433,"text":"In addition to the coming and going of endless streams I of Settlers, millions of Earthmen each year head out as emigrants to one or another of the Settler worlds."},{"id":4434,"text":"Some return almost at once, having failed to adapt."},{"id":4435,"text":"Others make new homes but come back particularly frequently to visit."},{"id":4436,"text":"There's no way of keeping track of exits and entrances and Earth doesn't even try."},{"id":4437,"text":"To attempt to set up systematic methods for identifying and keeping track of visitors might stem the flow and Earth is very aware that each visitor brings money with him."},{"id":4438,"text":"The tourist trade-if we want to call it that-is currently Earth's most profitable industry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You are saying, I suppose, that we can get the humanoid robots into Earth without trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With no trouble at all."},{"id":4439,"text":"There's no question in my mind as to that."},{"id":4440,"text":"Now that we have them properly programmed, we can send them to Earth in half a dozen batches with forged papers."},{"id":4441,"text":"We can't do anything, about their robotic respect and awe of human beings, but that may not give them away."},{"id":4442,"text":"It will be interpreted as the usual Settler respect and awe for the ancestral planet. -But, then, I strongly suspect we don't have to drop them into one of the City airports."},{"id":4443,"text":"The vast spaces between Cities are virtually untenanted except by primitive work-robots and the incoming ships would go unnoticed-or at least disregarded.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Too risky, I think,\" said Amadiro."},{"id":4444,"text":"Two batches of humanoid robots were sent to Earth and these mingled with the Earth people of the City before finding their way outward into the blank areas between and communicating with Aurora on shielded hyperbeam."},{"id":4445,"text":"Mandamus said (he had thought about it deeply and had hesitated long), \"I will have to go again, Sir."},{"id":4446,"text":"I can't be positive they've found the right spot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure you know the right spot, Mandamus?\" asked Amadiro, sardonically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have delved into Earth's ancient history thoroughly, sir."},{"id":4447,"text":"I know I can find it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I can persuade the Council, to send a warship with you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, I wouldn't want that."},{"id":4448,"text":"It would be worse than useless."},{"id":4449,"text":"I want a one-person vessel, with just enough power to get there and back.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in that way, Mandamus made his second visit to Earth, dropping down into a region outside one of the smaller Cities."},{"id":4450,"text":"With mingled relief and satisfaction, he found several of the robots in the right place and remained with them to view their work, to give a few orders in connection with that work, and to make some fine adjustments in their programming."},{"id":4451,"text":"And then, under the uninterested glance of a few primitive Earth-formed agricultural robots, Mandamus made for the nearby City."},{"id":4452,"text":"It was a calculated risk and Mandamus, no fearless hero, could feel his heart thudding uncomfortably within his chest."},{"id":4453,"text":"But it went well."},{"id":4454,"text":"There was some surprise shown by the gate warden when a human being presented himself at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLate, showing all signs of having spent a considerable time in the open\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus had papers identifying him as a Settler, however, and the warden shrugged."},{"id":4455,"text":"Settlers didn't mind the open and it was far from unheard of for them to take small excursions through the fields and woods that lay about the unimpressive upper layers of a City that jutted above the ground."},{"id":4456,"text":"The warden gave but a cursory glance at his papers and no one else asked for them at all."},{"id":4457,"text":"Mandamus's off-Earth accent (as weakly Auroran as he could make it) was accepted without comment and, as nearly, as he could tell, no one wondered whether he might be a Spacer."},{"id":4458,"text":"But, then, why should they?"},{"id":4459,"text":"The days when the Spacers held a permanent outpost on Earth was two centuries in the past and official emissaries from the Spacer worlds were few and-of late growing steadily fewer."},{"id":4460,"text":"The provincial Earthpeople might not even remember that Spacers existed."},{"id":4461,"text":"Mandamus was a little concerned that the thin, transparent gloves he always wore might be noted or that his nose plugs would be remarked upon, but neither event took place."},{"id":4462,"text":"No restrictions were placed on his travels around the City or to other Cities."},{"id":4463,"text":"He had enough money for that and money spoke loudly on Earth (and, to tell the truth, even on Spacer worlds)."},{"id":4464,"text":"He grew accustomed to having no robot dog his heels and when he met with some of Aurora's own humanoid robots in this City or that, he had to explain to them quite firmly that they must not dog his heels."},{"id":4465,"text":"He listened to their reports, gave them any instructions they seemed to require, and made arrangements for further robot shipments out-of-City."},{"id":4466,"text":"Eventually, he found his way back to his ship and left."},{"id":4467,"text":"He was not challenged on his way, out, any more than he had been on his way in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Actually,\" he said thoughtfully to Amadiro, \"these Earthpeople are not

their friendliness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Are you beginning to regret the task you're engaged in?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It does give me a grisly feeling as I wander among them thinking that, they don't know

is done, you will be sure of a post as the head of the Institute before very much time has elapsed."},{"id":4471,"text":"That will sweeten the job for you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Amadiro kept a close eye on Mandamus thereafter."},{"id":4472,"text":"On Mandamus's third trip, much of his earlier uneasiness had worn off and he could carry himself almost as though he were an Earthman."},{"id":4473,"text":"The project was proceeding slowly but dead center along the projected line of progress."},{"id":4474,"text":"He had experienced no health problems on his earlier visits, but on this third one-no doubt due to his overconfidence-he must have exposed himself to something or other."},{"id":4475,"text":"At least, for a time he had an alarming drippiness of the nose, accompanied by a cough."},{"id":4476,"text":"A visit to one of the City dispensaries resulted in a gamma globulin injection that relieved the condition at once, but he found the dispensary more frightening than the illness."},{"id":4477,"text":"Everyone there, he knew, was likely to be ill with something contagious or to be in close contact with those who were ill."},{"id":4478,"text":"But now, at last, he was back in the quiet orderliness of Aurora and incredibly thankful to be so."},{"id":4479,"text":"He was listening to Amadiro's account of the Solarian crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard nothing of it at all?\" demanded Amadiro."},{"id":4480,"text":"Mandamus shook his head. \"Nothing, sir."},{"id":4481,"text":"Earth is an incredibly provincial world."},{"id":4482,"text":"Eight hundred Cities with a total of eight billion people-all interested in nothing but the eight hundred Cities with a total of eight billion

one City deal about ninety percent of the time with that City alone."},{"id":4486,"text":"Earth is an enclosed, claustrophilic world, mentally as well as physically.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And yet you say

mind."},{"id":4488,"text":"The problem at the moment is Solaria."},{"id":4489,"text":"Not one of the Spacer worlds will move."},{"id":4490,"text":"The principle of noninterference is paramount and they insist that Solaria's internal problems are for Solaria alone."},{"id":4491,"text":"Our own Chairman is as inert as any other, even though Fastolfe is dead and his palsied hand no longer rests on us all."},{"id":4492,"text":"I can do nothing by myself-until such time as I am Chairman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus said, \"How can they suppose Solaria to have internal problems that may not be interfered with when the Solarians are gone?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro said sardonically, \"How is it you see the folly of it at once and they don't? -They say there is no hard evidence that the Solarians are totally gone and as long as they - or even some of them - might be on the world, there is no right for any other Spacer world to intrude uninvited.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How do they explain the absence of radiational activity?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They say that the Solarians may have moved underground or that they may have developed a technological advance of some sort that obviates radiation leakage."},{"id":4493,"text":"They also say that the Solarians were not seen to leave and that they have absolutely nowhere to go to."},{"id":4494,"text":"Of course, they were not seen leaving because no one was watching.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus said, \"How do they argue that the Solarians have nowhere to go to?"},{"id":4495,"text":"There are many empty worlds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The argument is that the Solarians cannot live without their incredible crowds of robots and they can't take those robots with them."},{"id":4496,"text":"If they came here, for instance, how, many robots do you suppose we could allot to them-if any?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And what is your argument against that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I haven't any."},{"id":4497,"text":"Still, whether they are gone or not, the situation is strange and puzzling and it is incredible that no one will move to investigate it."},{"id":4498,"text":"I've warned everyone, just as strenuously as I can, that inertia and apathy will be the end of us; that as soon as the Settler worlds become aware of the fact that Solaria was-or might be-empty, they would have no hesitation in investigating the matter."},{"id":4499,"text":"Those swarmers have a mindless curiosity that I wish we had some share in."},{"id":4500,"text":"They will, without thinking twice, risk their lives if some profit lures them on.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What profit in this case, Dr."},{"id":4501,"text":"Amadiro?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If the Solarians are gone, they have, perforce, left almost all their robots behind."},{"id":4502,"text":"They are-or were -particularly ingenious roboticists and the Settlers, for all their hatred of robots, will not hesitate to appropriate them and ship them to us for good Space credits."},{"id":4503,"text":"In fact, they have announced this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Two Settler ships have already landed on Solaria."},{"id":4504,"text":"We have sent a protest over this, but they will surely disregard the protest and, just as surely, we will do nothing further."},{"id":4505,"text":"Quite the contrary."},{"id":4506,"text":"Some of the Spacer worlds are sending out quiet queries as to the nature of the robots that might be salvaged and what their prices would, be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps just as well,\" said Mandamus quietly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Just as well that we're behaving exactly as the Settler propagandists say we will?"},{"id":4507,"text":"That we act as though we are degenerating and turning into soft pulps of decadence?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why repeat their buzz words, sir?"},{"id":4508,"text":"The fact is that we are quiet and civilized and have not yet been touched where it hurts."},{"id":4509,"text":"If we were, we would fight back strongly enough and, I'm sure, smash them."},{"id":4510,"text":"We still far outstrip them technologically.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But the damage to ourselves will not be exactly pleasurable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Which means that we must not be too ready to go to war."},{"id":4511,"text":"If Solaria is deserted and the Settlers wish to plunder it\" perhaps we ought to let them."},{"id":4512,"text":"After all, I predict that we will be all set to make our move within months.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA rather hungry and ferocious look came over Amadiro's face. \"Months?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure of it."},{"id":4513,"text":"So the first thing we must do is to avoid being provoked."},{"id":4514,"text":"We will ruin everything if we move toward a conflict

damage. -Poor, Earth!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If you're going to be sorry for them,\" said Amadiro with spurious lightness, \"perhaps you'll do nothing to them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" said Mandamus coolly. \"It's precisely because I fully intend to do something to them-and know that it will be done-that I am sorry for them."},{"id":4516,"text":"You will be

snarl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do not look that far ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am quite---\" began Amadiro, but was interrupted by the steady buzz of the message unit."},{"id":4517,"text":"Without looking and quite automatically, Amadiro placed his hand at the EXIT slot."},{"id":4518,"text":"He looked at the thin strip of paper that emerged and a slow smile appeared on his lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The two Settler ships that landed on Solaria-\" he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir?\" asked Mandamus, frowning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Destroyed!"},{"id":4519,"text":"Both destroyed!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In an explosive blaze of radiation, easily detected from space."},{"id":4520,"text":"You see what it means?"},{"id":4521,"text":"The Solarians have not left after all and the weakest of our worlds can easily handle Settler ships."},{"id":4522,"text":"It is a bloody nose for the Settlers and not something they'll forget. -Here, Mandamus, read for yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus pushed the paper aside. \"But that doesn't necessarily mean that the Solarians are still on the planet."},{"id":4523,"text":"They may merely have booby-trapped it somehow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What is the difference?"},{"id":4524,"text":"Personal attack or booby-trap, the ships were destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This time they were caught by surprise."},{"id":4525,"text":"What about next time, when they are prepared?"},{"id":4526,"text":"And what if they consider the event a deliberate Spacer attack?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We will reply that the Solarians were merely defending themselves against a deliberate Settler invasion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, are you suggesting a battle of words?"},{"id":4527,"text":"What if the Settlers don\" t bother talking, but consider the destruction of their ships an act of war and retaliate at once?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why should they?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Because they are as insane as we can be once pride is hurt; more so, since they have a greater background of violence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They will be beaten.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You yourself admit they will inflict unacceptable damage upon us, even if they are beaten. \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What would you have me do?"},{"id":4528,"text":"Aurora did not destroy those ships.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Persuade the Chairman to make it quite plain that Aurora had nothing to do with it, that none of the Spacer worlds had anything to do with it, that the blame for the action rests on Solaria alone.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And abandon Solaria?"},{"id":4529,"text":"That would be a cowardly act.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus blazed into excitement. \"Dr."},{"id":4530,"text":"Amadiro, have you never heard of anything called a strategic retreat?"},{"id":4531,"text":"Persuade the Spacer worlds to back off for only a little while on some plausible pretext."},{"id":4532,"text":"It is only a matter of some months till our plan on Earth comes to fruition."},{"id":4533,"text":"It may be hard for everyone else to back off and be apologetic to the Spacers, for they don't know what is coming-but we do."},{"id":4534,"text":"In fact, you and I, with our special knowledge, can look upon this event as a gift from what used to be called the gods."},{"id":4535,"text":"Let the Settlers remain preoccupied with Solaria while their destruction is prepared-all unobserved by them-on Earth. -Or would you prefer us to, be ruined on the very brink of final victory?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro, found himself flinching before the direct glare of the other's deep-set eyes."},{"id":4536,"text":"Amadiro had never had a worse time than during the period following the destruction of the Settler ships."},{"id":4537,"text":"The Chairman, fortunately, could be persuaded to follow a policy of what Amadiro termed \"masterful yielding.\" The phrase caught the Chairman's imagination, even though it was an oxymoron."},{"id":4538,"text":"Besides, the Chairman was good at masterful yielding."},{"id":4539,"text":"The rest of the Council was harder to handle."},{"id":4540,"text":"The exasperated Amadiro exhausted himself in picturing the horrors of war and the necessity of choosing the proper moment to strike-and not the improper one-if war there must be."},{"id":4541,"text":"He invented novel plausibilities for why the moment was not yet and used them in discussions with the leaders of the other Spacer Worlds."},{"id":4542,"text":"Aurora's natural hegemony had to be exercised to the utmost to get them to yield."},{"id":4543,"text":"But when Captain D."},{"id":4544,"text":"G."},{"id":4545,"text":"Baley arrived with his ship and his demand, Amadiro felt he could do no more."},{"id":4546,"text":"It was too much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is altogether impossible,\" said Amadiro. \"Are we to allow him to land on Aurora with his beard, his ridiculous clothing, his incomprehensible accent?"},{"id":4547,"text":"Am I expected to ask the Council to agree to hand over a Spacer woman to him?"},{"id":4548,"text":"It would be an act absolutely unprecedented in our history."},{"id":4549,"text":"A Spacer woman!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus said dryly, \"You have always referred to that particular Spacer woman as 'the Solarian woman.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"She is 'the Solarian woman' to us, but she will be considered a Spacer woman once a Settler is involved."},{"id":4550,"text":"If his ship lands on Solaria, as he suggests it will, it may be destroyed as the others were, together with him and the woman."},{"id":4551,"text":"I may then be accused by my enemies, with some color of justification, of murder-and my political career may not survive that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus said, \"Think, instead, of the fact that we have labored nearly seven years in order to arrange the final destruction of Earth and that we are now only a few months from the completion of the project."},{"id":4552,"text":"Shall we risk war now and, at a stroke, ruin everything we've done when we are so close to final victory?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro -shook his head. \"It isn't as though I have a choice in the matter, my friend."},{"id":4553,"text":"The Council wouldn't follow me if I try to argue them into surrendering the woman to -a Settler."},{"id":4554,"text":"And the mere fact that I have suggested it will be used against me."},{"id":4555,"text":"My political career will be shaken and we may then have a war in addition."},{"id":4556,"text":"Besides, the thought of a Spacer woman dying in service to a Settler is unbearable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One would suppose you were fond of the Solarian woman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You know I am not."},{"id":4557,"text":"With all my heart I wish she had died twenty decades ago, but not this way, not on a Settler ship."},{"id":4558,"text":"But I should remember that she is an ancestress of yours in the fifth generation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus looked a bit more dour than he usually did. \"Of what consequence is that to me?"},{"id":4559,"text":"I am a Spacer individual, conscious of myself and of my society."},{"id":4560,"text":"I am not an ancestor-worshiping member of a tribal conglomerate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Mandamus fell silent and his thin face took on a look of intense concentration. \"Dr."},{"id":4561,"text":"Amadiro,\" he said, \"could you not explain to the Council that this ancestress of mine is being taken, not as a Spacer hostage but only because her unique knowledge of Solaria, where she spent her childhood and youth, could make her an essential part of the exploration and that this exploration might even be helpful to us, as well as to the Settlers?"},{"id":4562,"text":"After all, in truth, wouldn't it be desirable for us to know what those miserable Solarians, are up to?"},{"id":4563,"text":"The woman will presumably bring back a report of the events-if she survives.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro thrust out his lower lip. \"That might work if the woman went on board voluntarily, if she made it clear that she understood the importance of the work and wished to perform her patriotic duty."},{"id":4564,"text":"To put her on board ship by force, though, is unthinkable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, suppose I were to see this ancestress of mine and try to persuade her to get on the ship willingly; and suppose, also, that you speak to this Settler captain by hyperwave and tell them he can land on Aurora and have the woman if he can persuade her to go with him willingly or, at least, say that she'll go with him willingly, whether she does or not.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we can't lose by making the effort, but I don't see how we can win.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYet to Amadiro's surprise, they did win."},{"id":4565,"text":"He had listened with astonishment as Mandamus told him the details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I brought up the matter of the humanoid robots,\" Mandamus said, \"and it's clear she knew nothing about them, from which I, deduced Fastolfe had known nothing about them."},{"id":4566,"text":"It has been one of those things that nagged at me."},{"id":4567,"text":"Then I talked a great deal about my ancestry in such a way as to force her to talk of that Earthman Elijah Baley.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What about him?\" said Amadiro harshly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, except that she talked about him and remembered."},{"id":4568,"text":"This Settler who wants her is adescendant of Baley and I thought it might influence her to consider the Settler's request more favorably than she might otherwise have done.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any case, it had worked and for a few, days Amadiro felt a relief from the almost continuous pressure that had plagued him from the start of the Solarian crisis."},{"id":4569,"text":"But only for a very few days."},{"id":4570,"text":"One point that worked to Amadiro's advantage at this time was that he had not seen Vasilia, thus far, during the Solarian crisis."},{"id":4571,"text":"It would certainly not have been an appropriate time to see her."},{"id":4572,"text":"He did not wish to be annoyed by her petty concern over a robot she claimed as her own-with total disregard for the legalities of the situation-at a time when a true crisis exercised his every nerve and thought."},{"id":4573,"text":"Nor did he wish to expose himself to the kind of quarrel that might easily arise.\" between her and Mandamus over the question of which was eventually to preside over the Robotics Institute."},{"id":4574,"text":"In any case, he had about come to the decision that Mandamus ought to be his successor."},{"id":4575,"text":"Throughout the Solarian crisis, he had kept his eye fixed on what was important."},{"id":4576,"text":"Even when Amadiro, himself had felt shaken, Mandamus had remained icily calm."},{"id":4577,"text":"It was-Mandamus who thought it conceivable that the Solarian woman might accompany the Settler captain voluntarily and it was he who maneuvered her into doing so."},{"id":4578,"text":"And if his plan for the destruction of Earth worked itself out as it should-as it must-then Amadiro, could see Mandamus succeeding as Council Chairman eventually."},{"id":4579,"text":"It would even be just, thought Amadiro, in a rare burst of selflessness."},{"id":4580,"text":"On this particular evening, in consequence, he did not so much as expend a thought upon Vasilia."},{"id":4581,"text":"He left the Institute with a small squad of robots seeing him safely to his ground-car."},{"id":4582,"text":"That ground-car, driven by one robot and with two more in the backseat with him, passed quietly through a twilit and chilly rain and brought him to his establishment, where two more robots ushered him indoors."},{"id":4583,"text":"And all this time he did not think of Vasilia."},{"id":4584,"text":"To find her sitting in his living room, then, in front of his hyperwave set, watching an intricate robot ballet, with several of Amadiro's robots in their niches and two of her own robots behind her chair, struck him at first not as much with the anger of violated privacy, as with pure surprise."},{"id":4585,"text":"It took some time for him to control his breathing well enough to be able to speak and then his anger arose and he said harshly, \"What are you doing here?"},{"id":4586,"text":"How did you get in?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia was calm enough."},{"id":4587,"text":"Amadiro's appearance was, after all, entirely expected. \"What I'm doing here,\" she said, \"is waiting to see you."},{"id":4588,"text":"Getting in was not difficult."},{"id":4589,"text":"Your robots know my appearance very well and they know my standing at the Institute."},{"id":4590,"text":"Why shouldn't they allow me to enter if I assure them I have an appointment with you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Which you haven't."},{"id":4591,"text":"You have violated my privacy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not really."},{"id":4592,"text":"There's a limit to how much trust you can squeeze out of someone else's robots."},{"id":4593,"text":"Look at them."},{"id":4594,"text":"They have never once taken their eyes from me."},{"id":4595,"text":"If I had wanted to disturb your belongings, look through your papers, take advantage of your absence in any way, I assure you I could not have."},{"id":4596,"text":"My two robots are no match against them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" said Amadiro, bitterly, \"that you have acted in a thoroughly un-Spacer fashion."},{"id":4597,"text":"You are despicable and I will not forget this.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia seemed to blanch slightly at the adjectives."},{"id":4598,"text":"She said in a low, hard voice, \"I hope you don't forget it, Kelden, for I've done what I've done for you- and if I reacted as I should to your foul, mouth, I would leave now and let you continue for the rest of your life to be the defeated man you have been for the past twenty decades.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I will not remain a defeated man-whatever you do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia said, \"You sound as though you believe that, but, you see, you do not know what I know."},{"id":4599,"text":"I must tell you that without my intervention you will remain defeated."},{"id":4600,"text":"I don't care what scheme you have in mind."},{"id":4601,"text":"I don't care what this thin-lipped, acid-faced Mandamus has cooked up for you-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why do you mention him?\" said Amadiro quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Because I wish to,\"- said Vasilia with a touch of contempt. \"Whatever he has done or thinks he is doing-and don't be frightened, for I haven't any idea what that might be-it won't work."},{"id":4602,"text":"I may not know anything else about it, but I do know it won't work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You're babbling idiocies,\" said Amadiro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You had better listen to these idiocies, Kelden, if you don't want everything to fall into ruin."},{"id":4603,"text":"Not just you, but possibly the Spacer worlds, one and all."},{"id":4604,"text":"Still, you may not want to listen to me."},{"id":4605,"text":"It's your choice.\" Which, then, is it to be?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why should I listen to you?"},{"id":4606,"text":"What possible reason is there for me to listen to you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For one thing, I told you the Solarians were preparing to leave their world."},{"id":4607,"text":"If you had listened to me then, you would not have been caught so by surprise when they did,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Solarian crisis will yet turn to our advantage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, it will not,\" said Vasilia. \"You may think it will, but it won't."},{"id":4608,"text":"It will destroy you-no matter what you are doing to meet the emergency- unless you are willing to let me have my say.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro's lips were white and were trembling slightly."},{"id":4609,"text":"The two centuries of defeat Vasilia had mentioned had had a lasting effect upon him and the Solarian

ask me-very politely-to stay and help you."},{"id":4614,"text":"Shall I start?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro said nothing and Vasilia began, \"I told you that during my stay on Solaria I became aware of

back to my childhood when Fastolfe, whom I then considered my father, in one of his generous moods-he would experiment now and then with generous moods, you understand-gave me a robot of my

patterns."},{"id":4620,"text":"With the passing of scores of decades, my knowledge of mathematics steadily improved, but I don't think I have advanced very far in my feeling for

he would feel pain.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Or else I would take one of my patterns to him and he would smile indulgently and say, 'Well, that won't hurt him, Little Vas, and it might be interesting to

sadistic joy of it, as I imagine I might have been tempted to do if I were someone other than myself."},{"id":4630,"text":"The fact is, I was very fond of Giskard and I had no desire to harm him."},{"id":4631,"text":"When it seemed to me that one of my improvements-I always thought of them as improvements- made Giskard speak more freely or react more quickly or more."},{"id":4632,"text":"interestingly -and seemed to do no harm-I would let it stay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And then one day---\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA robot standing at Amadiro's elbow would not have dared

walked into Amadiro's dining room, which Vasilia had never entered before."},{"id":4635,"text":"Amadiro was, after all, a private person and was notorious for his neglect of the social amenities."},{"id":4636,"text":"He had been told more than once that he would succeed better in politics if he entertained in his home and he had always smiled politely and said, \"Too high a price.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps because of his failure to entertain, thought Vasilia, that there was no sign of originality or creativity in the furnishings."},{"id":4637,"text":"Nothing could be plainer than, the table, the dishes, and the cutlery."},{"id":4638,"text":"As for the walls, they were merely flat colored vertical planes."},{"id":4639,"text":"Put together, in rather dampened

on, Vasilia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia said, \"And then one day I came up with a pattern more elaborate, more pleasant, and more enticing than I had ever seen before or, in all truth, than I have ever seen since."},{"id":4648,"text":"I- would have loved to show it to my father, but he was away at some meeting or other on one of the other worlds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know when he'd be back and

not."},{"id":4651,"text":"It seemed so beautiful that I thought it ludicrous to suppose it could do harm."},{"id":4652,"text":"I was only an infant in my second decade and had not yet completely

obvious."},{"id":4654,"text":"He responded to me with perfect ease and-it seemed to me was far quicker in understanding and much more intelligent than he had been."},{"id":4655,"text":"I found him far more fascinating and lovable than before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was delighted and yet I was nervous, too."},{"id":4656,"text":"What I had done-modifying Giskard without clearing it with Fastolfe was strictly against the rules Fastolfe had set for me and I knew that well."},{"id":4657,"text":"Yet clearly, I was not going to undo what I had done."},{"id":4658,"text":"When I had modified Giskard's brain, I excused it to myself by saying that it would only be for a little while and that I would then neutralize the modification."},{"id":4659,"text":"Once the modification had been made, however, it became quite clear to me that I would not neutralize it."},{"id":4660,"text":"I was simply not going to do that."},{"id":4661,"text":"In fact, I never modified Giskard again, for fear of disturbing what I had just done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nor did I ever tell Fastolfe what I had done."},{"id":4662,"text":"I destroyed all record of the marvelous pattern I had devised and Fastolfe never found out that Giskard had been modified without his knowledge."},{"id":4663,"text":"Never!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And then we went our separate ways, Fastolfe and I, and Fastolfe would not give up Giskard."},{"id":4664,"text":"I screamed that he was mine and that I loved him, but Fastolfe's kindly benevolence, of which he made such a parade all his life-that business of loving all things, great and small-was never allowed to stand in the way of his own desires."},{"id":4665,"text":"I received other robots I cared nothing for, but he kept Giskard for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And when he died, he left Giskard to the Solarian woman-a last bitter slap at me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro had only managed to get halfway through the, salmon mousse. \"If all this is intended to advance your case of having Giskard's ownership transferred from the Solarian woman to yourself, it won't help."},{"id":4666,"text":"I have already explained to you why I cannot set aside Fastolfe's will.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There's something more to it than that, Kelden,\" said Vasilia. \"A great deal more."},{"id":4667,"text":"Infinitely more."},{"id":4668,"text":"Do you want me to stop now?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro stretched his lips into a rueful grin. \"Having listened to so much of this, I will play the madman and listen to more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You would play the madman if you did not, for I now come to the point. -I have never stopped thinking of Giskard and of the cruelty and injustice of my having been deprived of him, but somehow I never thought of that pattern with which I had modified him with no one's knowledge but my own."},{"id":4669,"text":"I am quite certain I could not have reproduced that pattern if I had tried and from what I can now remember it was like nothing else I have ever seen in robotics until I saw, briefly, something like that pattern during my stay on Solaria.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Solarian pattern seemed familiar to me, but I didn't know why."},{"id":4670,"text":"It took some weeks of intense thought before I dredged out of some well-hidden part of my unconscious mind the slippery thought of that pattern I had dreamed out of nothing twenty-five decades ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Even though I can't remember my pattern exactly, I know that the Solarian pattern was a whiff of it and no more."},{"id":4671,"text":"It was just the barest suggestion of something I had captured in miraculously complex symmetry."},{"id":4672,"text":"But I looked at the Solarian pattern wit h the experience I had gained in twenty-five decades of deep immersion in robotics theory and it suggested telepathy to me."},{"id":4673,"text":"If that simple, scarcely interesting pattern suggested it, what must my original have meant-the thing I invented as a child and have never recaptured since?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro said, \"You keep saying that you're coming to the point, Vasilia."},{"id":4674,"text":"Would I be completely unreasonable if I asked you to stop moaning and reminiscing and simply set out that point in a simple, declarative sentence?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia said, \"Gladly."},{"id":4675,"text":"What I am telling you, Kelden, is that, without my ever knowing it, I converted Giskard into a telepathic robot and that he has been one ever since.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro looked at Vasilia for a long time and, because the story seemed to have come to an end, he returned to the salmon mousse and ate some of it thoughtfully."},{"id":4676,"text":"He then said, \"Impossible!"},{"id":4677,"text":"Do you take me for an idiot?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I take you for a failure,\" said Vasilia. \"I don't say Giskard can read conversations in minds, that he can transmit and receive words or ideas."},{"id":4678,"text":"Perhaps that is impossible, even in theory."},{"id":4679,"text":"But I am quite certain he can detect emotions and the general set of mental activity and perhaps can even modify it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro shook his head violently. \"Impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Impossible?"},{"id":4680,"text":"Think a while."},{"id":4681,"text":"Twenty decades ago, you had almost achieved your aims."},{"id":4682,"text":"Fastolfe was at your mercy, Chairman Horder was your ally."},{"id":4683,"text":"What happened?"},{"id":4684,"text":"Why did everything go wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Earthman-\" Amadiro began, choking at the memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Earthman,\" Vasilia mimicked. \"The Earthman."},{"id":4685,"text":"Or was it the Solarian woman?"},{"id":4686,"text":"It was neither!"},{"id":4687,"text":"Neither!"},{"id":4688,"text":"It was Giskard, who was there all the time."},{"id":4689,"text":"Sensing."},{"id":4690,"text":"Adjusting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why should he be interested?"},{"id":4691,"text":"He is a robot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A robot loyal to his master, to Fastolfe."},{"id":4692,"text":"By the First Law, he had to see to it that Fastolfe came to no harm and, being telepathic, he could not interpret that as signifying physical harm only."},{"id":4693,"text":"He knew that if Fastolfe could not have his way, could not encourage the settlement of the habitable worlds of the Galaxy, he would undergo profound disappointment-and -that would be 'harm' in Giskard's telepathic Universe."},{"id":4694,"text":"He could not let that happen and he intervened to keep it from happening.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, no, no,\" said Amadiro in disgust. \"You want that to be so, out of some wild, romantic longing, but that doesn't make it so."},{"id":4695,"text":"I remember too well what happened."},{"id":4696,"text":"It was the Earthman."},{"id":4697,"text":"It needs no telepathic robot to explain the events.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And what has happened since, Kelden?\" demanded Vasilia. \"In twenty decades, have you ever managed to win out over Fastolfe?"},{"id":4698,"text":"With all the facts in your favor, with the obvious bankruptcy of Fastolfe's policy, have you ever been able to dispose of a majority in the Council?"},{"id":4699,"text":"Have you ever been able to sway the Chairman to the point where you could possess real power?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How do you explain that, Kelden?"},{"id":4700,"text":"In all those twenty decades, the Earthman has not been on Aurora."},{"id":4701,"text":"He has been, dead for over sixteen decades, his miserably short life running out in eight decades or so."},{"id":4702,"text":"Yet you continue to fail you have an unbroken record of failure."},{"id":4703,"text":"Even now that Fastolfe is dead, have you managed to profit completely from the broken pieces of his coalition or do you, find that success still seems to elude you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What is it that remains?"},{"id":4704,"text":"The Earthman is gone."},{"id":4705,"text":"Fastolfe is gone."},{"id":4706,"text":"It is Giskard who has worked against you all this time-and Giskard remains."},{"id":4707,"text":"He is as loyal now to the Solarian woman as he was to Fastolfe and the Solarian woman has no cause to love you, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro's face twisted into a mask of anger and frustration. \"It's not so."},{"id":4708,"text":"None of this is so."},{"id":4709,"text":"You're imagining things.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia remained quite cool. \"No, I'm not."},{"id":4710,"text":"I'm explaining things."},{"id":4711,"text":"I've explained things you haven't been able to explain."},{"id":4712,"text":"Or have you an alternate explanation? -And I can give you the cure."},{"id":4713,"text":"Transfer ownership of Giskard from the Solarian woman to me and, quite suddenly, events will begin to twist themselves to your benefit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Amadiro. \"They are moving to my benefit already.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You may think so, but they won't, as long as Giskard is working against you."},{"id":4714,"text":"No matter how close you come to winning, no matter how sure of victory you become, it will all melt away as long as you don't have Giskard on your side."},{"id":4715,"text":"That happened twenty decades ago; it will happen now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro's face suddenly cleared."},{"id":4716,"text":"He said, \"Well, come to think of it, though I don't have Giskard and neither do you, it doesn't matter, for I can show you that Giskard is not telepathic."},{"id":4717,"text":"If Giskard, were telepathic, as you say, if he had the ability to order affairs to his own liking or to the liking of the human being who is his owner, then why would he have allowed the Solarian woman to be taken to what will probably be her death?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Her death?"},{"id":4718,"text":"What are you talking about, Kelden?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Are you aware, Vasilia, that two Settler ships have been destroyed on Solaria?"},{"id":4719,"text":"Or have you been doing nothing lately but dreaming of patterns and of the brave days of childhood when you were modifying your pet robot?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sarcasm doesn't become you, Kelden."},{"id":4720,"text":"I have heard about the Settler ships on the

feeling that she knows the planet well enough to enable them to avoid destruction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia said, \"That's scarcely likely, since she hasn't been there in twenty decades.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Right!"},{"id":4725,"text":"The chances are, then, that she'll die with them."},{"id":4726,"text":"It would mean nothing to me personally."},{"id":4727,"text":"I would be delighted to have her dead and, I think, so would you."},{"id":4728,"text":"And, putting that to one side, it would give us good grounds for complaint to the Settler worlds and it would make it difficult for them to argue that the destruction of the ships is a deliberate action on the part of Aurora."},{"id":4729,"text":"Would we destroy one of our own? -Now the question is, Vasilia, why would Giskard, if he had the powers you claim he has-and the loyalties allow the Solarian woman to volunteer to be taken to what is very likely to be her death?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia was taken aback. \"Did she go of her own free will?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely."},{"id":4730,"text":"She was perfectly willing."},{"id":4731,"text":"It would have been politically impossible to force her to

in her seat, one hand to her chin."},{"id":4732,"text":"Then she said slowly, \"They don't allow robots on Settler worlds or on Settler ships."},{"id":4733,"text":"That means she went alone."},{"id":4734,"text":"Without robots.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, no, of course not."},{"id":4735,"text":"They had to accept personal robots if they expected to get her

ship?"},{"id":4742,"text":"Kelden, you may have ruined us all!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither finished the meal."},{"id":4743,"text":"Vasilia walked hastily out of the dining room and disappeared into the Personal."},{"id":4744,"text":"Amadiro, struggling to remain coldly logical, shouted to her through the closed door, perfectly aware that it damaged his dignity to do so."},{"id":4745,"text":"He called out, \"It's all the stronger an indication that Giskard is no more than a robot."},{"id":4746,"text":"Why should he be willing to go to Solaria to face destruction with his owner?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEventually, the sound of running water and splashing ceased and Vasilia emerged with her face freshly washed and almost frozen in its grip on calmness."},{"id":4747,"text":"She said, \"You really don't understand, do you?"},{"id":4748,"text":"You amaze me, Kelden."},{"id":4749,"text":"Think it through."},{"id":4750,"text":"Giskard can never be in danger, as long as he can influence human minds, can he?"},{"id":4751,"text":"Nor can the Solarian woman, as long as Giskard devotes himself to her."},{"id":4752,"text":"The Settler who carried off the Solarian woman must have found out, on interviewing her, that she had not been on Solaria in twenty decades, so he can't really have continued to believe, after that, that she could do him much good."},{"id":4753,"text":"With her he took Giskard, but he didn't know that Giskard could do him- good, either-Or could he have known that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe thought a while and then said slowly, \"No, there is no way he could have known it."},{"id":4754,"text":"If, in more than twenty decades, no one has penetrated the fact that Giskard has mental abilities, then Giskard is clearly interested in having no one guess it-and if that is so, then no one can possibly have guessed it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro said spitefully, \"You claim to have worked it out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia said, \"I had special knowledge, Kelden, and even so it was not till now that I saw the obvious -and then only because of the hint on Solaria."},{"id":4755,"text":"Giskard must have darkened my mind in that respect, too, or I would have seen it long ago."},{"id":4756,"text":"I wonder if Fastolfe knew---\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How much easier,\" said Amadiro restlessly, \"to accept the simple fact that Giskard is simply a robot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You will walk the easy road to ruin, Kelden, but I don't think I will let you do that, no matter how much you want to. -What it amounts to is that the Settler came for the Solarian woman and took her along, even though he discovered she would be of little-if any-use to him."},{"id":4757,"text":"And the Solarian woman- volunteered to go, even though she must dread being on a Settler ship along with diseased barbarians-and even though her destruction on Solaria must have seemed to her a very likely consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me, then, that this is all the work of Giskard, who forced the Settler to continue to demand the Solarian woman against reason and forced the Solarian woman to accede to the request against reason.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro, said, \"But why?"},{"id":4758,"text":"May I ask that simple question?"},{"id":4759,"text":"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I suppose, Kelden, that Giskard felt it was important to get away from Aurora. -Could he have guessed that I was on the point, of learning his secret?"},{"id":4760,"text":"If so, he may well have been uncertain of his present ability to tamper with me."},{"id":4761,"text":"I am, after all, a skilled roboticist."},{"id":4762,"text":"Besides, he would remember that he was once mine and a robot does not easily ignore the demands of loyalty."},{"id":4763,"text":"The only way, perhaps, that he felt he could keep the Solarian woman secure was to move himself away from my influence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe looked up at Amadiro and said firmly, \"Kelden, we must get him back."},{"id":4764,"text":"We can't let him, work at promoting the Settler cause in the safe haven of a Settler world."},{"id":4765,"text":"He did enough damage right here among

be destroyed on Solaria, but then he will have to return to Aurora."},{"id":4772,"text":"After all, the Solarian woman, though she is not an Auroran by birth, has lived on Aurora far too long to be able to face life among the barbarians--and when she insists on returning to civilization, Giskard will have no alternative but to return with her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia said, \"After all this, Kelden, you still don't understand Giskard's abilities."},{"id":4773,"text":"If he feels it important to remain away from Aurora, he can easily adjust the Solarian woman, s emotions in such a way as to make her stand life on a Settler world, just as he made her willing to board a Settler ship.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, if necessary, we can simply escort that Settler ship-with the Solarian woman and with Giskard back to Aurora.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How do you propose to do that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It can be done."},{"id":4774,"text":"We are not fools here on Aurora, for all that it seems clearly your opinion that you yourself are the only rational person on the planet."},{"id":4775,"text":"The Settler ship is going to Solaria to investigate the destruction, of the earlier two ships, but I hope you don't think we intend to depend upon its good offices or even upon those of the Solarian woman."},{"id":4776,"text":"We are sending two of our warships to Solaria and we do not expect that they will have trouble if there are Solarians still on the planet, they may be able to destroy primitive Settler ships, but they won't be able to touch an Auroran vessel of war."},{"id":4777,"text":"If, then, the Settler ship, through some magic on the part of Giskard-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not magic,\" Vasilia interrupted tartly. \"Mental influence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If, then, the Settler ship, for whatever reason, should be able to rise from the surface of Solaria, our ships will cut them off and politely ask for the delivery of the Solarian woman and her robots."},{"id":4778,"text":"Failing that, they will insist that the Settler ship accompany our ship to Aurora."},{"id":4779,"text":"There will be no hostility about it."},{"id":4780,"text":"Our ship will merely be escorting an Auroran national to her home world."},{"id":4781,"text":"Once the Solarian woman and her two robots disembark in Aurora, the Settler ship will then be able to proceed at will to its own destination.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia nodded wearily at this. \"It sounds good, Kelden, but do you know what I suspect will happen?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What, Vasilia?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is my opinion that the Settler ship will rise from the surface of Solaria, but that our warships won't."},{"id":4782,"text":"Whatever is on Solaria can be countered by Giskard, but, I fear, by nothing else.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If that happens,\" said Amadiro with a grim smile, \"then I'll admit there may be something, after all, to your fantasy. -But it won't happen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning Vasilia's chief personal robot, delicately designed to appear female, came to Vasilia's bedside."},{"id":4783,"text":"Vasilia stirred and, without opening her eyes, said, \"What is it, Nadila?\" (There was no need to open her eyes."},{"id":4784,"text":"In many decades, no one had ever approached her bedside but Nadila.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNadila said softly, \"Madam, you are desired at the Institute by Dr."},{"id":4785,"text":"Amadiro.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia's eyes flew open. \"What time is it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is 0517,

madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"His robots have not informed us, madam, but they say it is important.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia threw aside the bed sheets. \"I will have breakfast first, Nadila, and a shower before that."},{"id":4786,"text":"Inform Amadiro's robots to take visitors' niches and wait."},{"id":4787,"text":"If they urge speed, remind them they are in my establishment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia, annoyed, did not hasten unduly."},{"id":4788,"text":"If anything, her toilette was more painstaking than usual and her breakfast more leisurely. (She was not ordinarily one to, spend much time over either.) The news, which she watched, gave no indication of anything that might explain Amadiro's call."},{"id":4789,"text":"By the time the ground-car (containing herself and four robots -two of Amadiro's and two of her own) had brought her to the Institute, the sun was making its appearance over the horizon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro looked up and said, \"You are finally here, then."},{"id":4790,"text":"The walls of his office were still glowing, though their light was no longer needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Vasilia stiffly. \"I quite realize that sunrise is a terribly late hour at which to begin work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No games, Vasilia, please."},{"id":4791,"text":"Very soon I will have to be at the Council chamber."},{"id":4792,"text":"The Chairman has been up longer than I have.

destroyed, as you predicted. -The fact has not been publicized yet, but the news will leak out eventually, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia's eyes widened."},{"id":4794,"text":"She had predicted this outcome with a bit more in the way of outward confidence than she had felt, but clearly this was not the time to say, so."},{"id":4795,"text":"What she did say was \"Then you accept the fact that Giskard has extraordinary powers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCautiously, Amadiro said, \"I don't consider the matter to be mathematically proven, but I'm willing to accept it pending further information."},{"id":4796,"text":"What I want to know is what we ought to do next."},{"id":4797,"text":"The Council knows nothing of Giskard and I do, not propose to tell them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad your thinking is clear to that extend, Kelden.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But you're the one who understands Giskard and you can best tell what ought to be done."},{"id":4798,"text":"What do I tell the Council, then, and how do I explain the action without giving away the whole truth?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It depends."},{"id":4799,"text":"Now that the Settler ship has left Solaria, where is it going?"},{"id":4800,"text":"Can we tell?"},{"id":4801,"text":"After all, if it is returning now to Aurora, we need do nothing but prepare for its arrival.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is not coming to Aurora,\" said Amadiro emphatically. \"You were right here, too, it seems."},{"id":4802,"text":"Giskard- assuming he is running the show -seems determined to stay away."},{"id":4803,"text":"We have intercepted the ship's messages to, its own world."},{"id":4804,"text":"Encoded, of course, but there isn't a Settler code we haven't broken---\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I suspect they've broken ours, too."},{"id":4805,"text":"I wonder why everyone won't agree to send messages in the clear and save a lot of trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro shrugged it away. \"Never mind that."},{"id":4806,"text":"The point is that the Settler ship is going back to its own planet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With the Solarian woman and the robots?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You're sure of that?"},{"id":4807,"text":"They haven't been left on Solaria?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We're sure of that,\" said Amadiro impatiently. \"Apparently, 'the Solarian

Giskard."},{"id":4809,"text":"He made it appear to be the Solarian woman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And what do we do now?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We must get Giskard back.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I can't very well persuade the Council to risk an interstellar crisis over the return of a robot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You don't, Kelden."},{"id":4810,"text":"You ask for the return of the Solarian woman, something we certainly have a right to request."},{"id":4811,"text":"And do you think for one moment she would return without her robots?"},{"id":4812,"text":"Or that Giskard will allow the Solarian woman to return without him?"},{"id":4813,"text":"Or that the Settler world would want to keep the robots if the Solarian woman returns?"},{"id":4814,"text":"Ask for her."},{"id":4815,"text":"Firmly."},{"id":4816,"text":"She's an Auroran citizen, lent out for a job on Solaria, which is done, and she must now be returned forthwith."},{"id":4817,"text":"Make it belligerent, as though it were a threat of war.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We can't risk war, Vasilia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You won't risk it."},{"id":4818,"text":"Giskard can't take an action that might lead directly to war."},{"id":4819,"text":"If the Settler leaders resist and become belligerent in their return, Giskard will perforce make the necessary modifications in the attitude of the Settler leaders so as to have the Solarian woman returned peaceably to Aurora."},{"id":4820,"text":"And he himself will, of course, have to return with her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro said drearily, \"And once he's back, he will alter us, I suppose, and we will -forget his powers, and disregard him, and he will still be able to follow his own plan whatever it is."},{"id":4821,"text":"Vasilia leaned her head back and laughed. \"Not a chance."},{"id":4822,"text":"I know Giskard, you see, and I can handle him."},{"id":4823,"text":"Just bring him back and persuade the Council to disregard Fastolfe's will-it can be done and you can do it-and to assign Giskard to me."},{"id":4824,"text":"He will then be working for us; Aurora will rule the Galaxy you will spend the remaining decades of your life as

way?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely."},{"id":4825,"text":"Just send the message and make it strong and I will guarantee all the rest-victory for the Spacers, and ourselves, defeat for Earth and the

such occasions, she had made it a practice to turn away."},{"id":4932,"text":"She remembered him only as Fastolfe's great enemy and now that she found herself, for the first time, in the same room with him-in face-to-face confrontation she had to freeze her face into expressionlessness, in order not to allow hate to peep through."},{"id":4933,"text":"Although she and Amadiro were the only palpable human beings in the room, there were at least a dozen high officials-the Chairman himself among them-who were present by way of sealed-beam holovision."},{"id":4934,"text":"Gladia had recognized the Chairman and some of the others, but not all."},{"id":4935,"text":"It was rather a grisly experience."},{"id":4936,"text":"It seemed so like the viewing that was universal of Solaria and to which she had been so accustomed as a girl-and which she recalled with such distaste."},{"id":4937,"text":"She made an effort to speak clearly, undramatically, and concisely."},{"id":4938,"text":"When asked a question, she was as brief as was consistent with clarity and as noncommittal as was consistent with courtesy."},{"id":4939,"text":"The Chairman listened impassively and the others took their cue from him."},{"id":4940,"text":"He was clearly elderly -Chairmen always were, somehow, for it was usually late in life that they attained the position."},{"id":4941,"text":"He had a long face, a still thick head of hair, and prominent eyebrows."},{"id":4942,"text":"His voice was mellifluous, but in no way friendly."},{"id":4943,"text":"When Gladia was done, he said, \"It is your suggestion, then, that the Solarians, had redefined 'human being' in a narrow sense that restricted it to Solarians.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do not suggest anything, Mr."},{"id":4944,"text":"Chairman."},{"id":4945,"text":"It is merely that no one has been able to think of another explanation that would account for the events.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Are you aware, Madam Gladia, that in all the history of robotic science, no robot has ever been designed with a narrowed definition of 'human being'?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am not a roboticist,

that."},{"id":4948,"text":"I cannot say, of my own knowledge, however, whether the fact that it has never been done means that it can never be done in the future.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHer eyes had never looked as wide and innocent as they did now and the Chairman flushed and said, \"It is not theoretically impossible to narrow the definition, but it is unthinkable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia said, with a downcast glance at her hands, which were loosely clasped in her lap, \"People can think such peculiar things sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chairman changed the subject and said, \"An Auroran ship was destroyed."},{"id":4949,"text":"How do you account for that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was not present at the site of the incident, Mr."},{"id":4950,"text":"Chairman."},{"id":4951,"text":"I have no idea what happened, so I can't account for it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You were on Solaria and you were born on the planet."},{"id":4952,"text":"Given your recent experience and early background, what would you say happened?\" The Chairman showed signs of a badly strained patience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If I must guess,\" said Gladia, \"I should say that our warship was exploded by the use of a portable nuclear intensifier similar to the one that was almost used on the Settler ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Does it not strike you, however, that the two cases are different."},{"id":4953,"text":"In one, a Settler ship invaded Solaria to confiscate Solarian -robots; in the other, an Auroran vessel came to -Solaria to help protect a sister planet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I can only suppose, Mr."},{"id":4954,"text":"Chairman, that the overseers the humanoid robots left to guard the planet-were insufficiently well-instructed to know the difference.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chairman looked offended. \"It is inconceivable that they would not be instructed in the difference between Settlers and fellow Spacers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If you say so, Mr."},{"id":4955,"text":"Chairman."},{"id":4956,"text":"Nevertheless, if the only definition of a human being is someone with the physical appearance of a human being, together with the ability to speak in Solarian fashion-as it seemed to us, who were on the spot, that it must be-then Aurorans, who do not speak in Solarian fashion, might not fall under the heading of human beings where the overseers were concerned.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then you are saying that the Solarians, defined their fellow Spacers as nonhuman and subjected them to destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I present it merely as a possibility because I can't think of any other way to explain the destruction of any Auroran warship."},{"id":4957,"text":"More experienced people may be able to present alternate explanations, to be sure.\" Again that innocent, almost blank, look."},{"id":4958,"text":"The Chairman said, \"Are you planning to return to Solaria, Madam Gladia?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, Mr."},{"id":4959,"text":"Chairman, I have no such plan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Have you been requested to do so by your Settler friend, in order to clear the planet of its overseers?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly Gladia shook her head. \"I have not been requested to do this."},{"id":4960,"text":"Had I been, I would have refused."},{"id":4961,"text":"Nor did I go to Solaria, to begin with, for any reason but that of fulfilling my duty to Aurora."},{"id":4962,"text":"I was requested to go to Solaria by Dr., Levular Mandamus of the Robotics Institute, working under Dr."},{"id":4963,"text":"Kelden Amadiro."},{"id":4964,"text":"I was requested to go so that, on my return, I might report on events -as I have just done."},{"id":4965,"text":"The request had, to my ears and understanding, the flavor of an order and I took the order\" -she glanced briefly in Amadiro's direction- \"as coming from Dr."},{"id":4966,"text":"Amadiro himself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro made no visible response to that."},{"id":4967,"text":"The Chairman said, \"What are your plans for the future, then?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia waited a heartbeat or two, then decided she might as well confront the situation boldly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is my intention, Mr."},{"id":4968,"text":"Chairman,\" said Gladia, speaking very clearly, \"to visit Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarth?"},{"id":4969,"text":"Why should you wish to visit Earth?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It may be important, Mr."},{"id":4970,"text":"Chairman, for Auroran authorities to know what is taking place on Earth."},{"id":4971,"text":"Since I have been invited by the Baleyworld authorities to visit Earth and since Captain Baley stands ready to take me there, it would be an opportunity to bring back a report on events-as I have now reported on events taking place on Solaria and on Baleyworld.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, then, thought Gladia, will he violate the custom and, in effect, imprison her on Aurora?"},{"id":4972,"text":"If so, there had to be ways of challenging the decision."},{"id":4973,"text":"Gladia felt her tension rising and she cast a quick glance in the direction of Daneel, who, of course, seemed totally impassive."},{"id":4974,"text":"However, the Chairman, looking sour, said, \"In that respect, Madam Gladia, you have the right of an Auroran to do as you wish -but it will be on your own responsibility."},{"id":4975,"text":"No one is requesting this of you, as some requested, according to you, your visit to Solaria."},{"id":4976,"text":"For that reason I must warn you that Aurora will not feel bound to help you in case of any misadventure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I understand that, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chairman said brusquely, \"There will -be much to discuss on the matter later on, Amadiro."},{"id":4977,"text":"I will be in touch with you. \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe images blanked out and Gladia found herself and her robots suddenly alone with Amadiro and his robots."},{"id":4978,"text":"Gladia rose and said stiffly, carefully refusing to look directly at Amadiro as she did so, \"The meeting, I presume, is over, so I will now leave.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course, but I have a question or two, which I hope you don't mind my asking.\" His tall figure seemed overwhelming as he rose and he smiled and addressed her in all courtesy, as though friendliness were long established between them. \"Let me escort you, Lady Gladia."},{"id":4979,"text":"So you are going to Earth?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes."},{"id":4980,"text":"The, Chairman raised no objections and an Auroran citizen may freely travel through the Galaxy in time of peace."},{"id":4981,"text":"And pardon me, but my robots-and yours, if necessary-will be sufficient escort.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As you say, my lady.\" A robot held the door open for them. \"I assume you will take robots with you when you go to Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There's no question as to that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Which robots, madam, if I may ask?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"These two."},{"id":4982,"text":"The two robots I have with me.\" Her shoes made a firm clicking sound as she walked rapidly along the corridor, her back to Amadiro, making no effort to see to it that he heard her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is that wise, my lady?"},{"id":4983,"text":"They are advanced robots, unusual products of the great Dr."},{"id":4984,"text":"Fastolfe."},{"id":4985,"text":"You will be surrounded by barbarian Earthmen, who may covet them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Should they covet them, they nevertheless wouldn't get them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Don't underestimate the danger, nor overestimate robotic protection."},{"id":4986,"text":"You will be in one of their Cities, surrounded by tens of millions of these Earthmen, and robots may not harm human beings."},{"id":4987,"text":"Indeed, the more advanced a robot, the more sensitive it is to the nuances of the Three Laws and the less likely it is to take any action that will harm a human being in any way. -Isn't that so, Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Dr."},{"id":4988,"text":"Amadiro,\" said Daneel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Giskard, I imagine,

others."},{"id":4990,"text":"On Earth-mad, decadent, barbarous-there will be no way two robots can protect you or themselves."},{"id":4991,"text":"We would not want you to be deprived."},{"id":4992,"text":"Nor, to place it on a more selfish basis, would we of the Institute and the government care to see advanced robots in the hands of the barbarians."},{"id":4993,"text":"Would it not be better to take robots, of a more ordinary type that the Earthpeople would ignore?"},{"id":4994,"text":"You can take any number in that case."},{"id":4995,"text":"A dozen if you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia said, \"Dr."},{"id":4996,"text":"Amadiro, I took these two robots on a Settler ship and visited a Settler world."},{"id":4997,"text":"No one made a move to appropriate them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Settlers don't use robots and claim to disapprove of them."},{"id":4998,"text":"On Earth itself, they still use robots.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"If I may interpose, Dr."},{"id":4999,"text":"Amadiro-It is my understanding that robots are being phased out on Earth."},{"id":5000,"text":"Mere are very few in the Cities."},{"id":5001,"text":"Almost all robots on Earth are now used in agricultural or mining operations."},{"id":5002,"text":"For the rest, nonrobotic automation is the norm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro looked at Daneel briefly, then said to Gladia, \"Your robot is probably right and I suppose there would be no harm in taking Daneel."},{"id":5003,"text":"He could well pass as human, for that matter."},{"id":5004,"text":"Giskard, however, may well be left in your establishment."},{"id":5005,"text":"He might arouse the acquisitive instincts of an acquisitive society-even if it is true that they are trying to free themselves of robots.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia said, \"Neither will be left, sir."},{"id":5006,"text":"They will come with me."},{"id":5007,"text":"I am the sole judge of which portions of my property may come with me and which may not.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Of course.\" Amadiro smiled in his most amiable fashion. \"No one disputes that. -Would you wait here?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother door opened, showing a room that was most comfortably furnished."},{"id":5008,"text":"It was without windows, but was illuminated by soft light and suffused with even softer music."},{"id":5009,"text":"Gladia stopped at the threshold and said sharply, \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A member of the Institute wishes to see you and speak to you."},{"id":5010,"text":"It will not take long, but it is necessary."},{"id":5011,"text":"Once that is done, you are free to go."},{"id":5012,"text":"You will not even be plagued by my presence from this moment on."},{"id":5013,"text":"Please.\" There was a touch of hidden steel in the last word."},{"id":5014,"text":"Gladia reached out her arms for Daneel and Giskard. \"We enter together.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro laughed genially. \"Do you think I'm trying to separate you from your robots?"},{"id":5015,"text":"Do you think they would allow that?"},{"id":5016,"text":"You have been too long with Settlers, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia looked at the closed door and said between her teeth, \"I dislike that man intensely."},{"id":5017,"text":"And most intensely when he smiles and tries to be soothing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe stretched, her elbow joints cracking slightly. \"In any case, I'm tired."},{"id":5018,"text":"If someone comes with further questions about Solaria and Baleyworld, they are going to get short answers, I tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe sat down on a couch that gave softly under her weight."},{"id":5019,"text":"She slipped her shoes off and lifted her feet to the couch."},{"id":5020,"text":"She smiled sleepily, took a deep breath as she sank to one side, and, with her head turned away from the room, was instantly and deeply asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is well she was naturally sleepy,\" said Giskard. \"I was able to deepen it without any hint of damage to her at all. -I would not want Lady Gladia to hear what is likely to come.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What is likely to come, friend Giskard?\" asked Daneel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What is to come is the result, I think, of my being wrong, friend Daneel, and of your being right."},{"id":5021,"text":"I should have taken your excellent mind more seriously.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is you, then, they want to keep on Aurora?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes."},{"id":5022,"text":"And in urgently calling for Lady Gladia's return, they were calling for mine."},{"id":5023,"text":"You heard Dr."},{"id":5024,"text":"Amadiro ask for us to be left behind."},{"id":5025,"text":"At first both of us and then myself alone.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Might it be that his words have but the surface meaning, that he feels it dangerous to lose an advanced robot to the Earthmen?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There was an underlying current of anxiety, friend Daneel, that I judge to be far too strong to match his words.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell whether he knows of your special abilities?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot tell directly, since I cannot read thoughts themselves."},{"id":5026,"text":"Nevertheless, twice in the course of the interview with the Council members, there was a sudden sharp rise in the level of emotional intensity in Dr."},{"id":5027,"text":"Amadiro's mind."},{"id":5028,"text":"Extraordinarily sharp rises."},{"id":5029,"text":"I cannot describe it in words, but it would be analogous, perhaps, to, watching a scene in black and white and having it splash-suddenly and briefly-into intense color.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When did this happen, friend Giskard?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The second time was when Lady Gladia mentioned she would be going to Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That created no visible stir among the Council members."},{"id":5030,"text":"What were their minds like?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I could not tell."},{"id":5031,"text":"They were present through holovision and such images are not accompanied by any mental sensations that I can detect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We may conclude, then, that whether-the Council is or is not-disturbed by Lady Gladia's projected trip to Earth, Dr."},{"id":5032,"text":"Amadiro, at least, is disturbed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is not simple disturbance."},{"id":5033,"text":"Dr."},{"id":5034,"text":"Amadiro seemed anxious in the highest degree; as we would expect, for instance, if he indeed had a project in hand, as we suspect, for the destruction of Earth and feared its discovery."},{"id":5035,"text":"What is more, At Lady Gladia's mention of this intention of hers, friend Daneel, Dr."},{"id":5036,"text":"Amadiro glanced briefly at me; the only moment in all the session that he did."},{"id":5037,"text":"The flash of emotional intensity coincided with that glance."},{"id":5038,"text":"I think it was the thought of my going to Earth that made him anxious. -As we might expect, if he felt that I, with my special powers, would be a particular danger to his plans.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"His actions might also be taken, friend Giskard, as fitting his expressed fear that the Earthmen would try to appropriate you as an advanced robot and that this would be -bad, for Aurora.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The chance of that happening, friend Daneel, and the extent of damage that might do the Spacer community is too small to account for his level of anxiety."},{"id":5039,"text":"What harm could I do Aurora if I were in Earth's possession-if I were simply the Giskard I am taken to be?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You conclude, then, that

knew what I was, would he not make every effort to avoid making his plans in my presence?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It may simply be his misfortune that Lady Gladia will not be separated from us."},{"id":5043,"text":"He cannot insist on your not being present, friend Giskard, without giving away his knowledge to you.\" Daneel paused, then said, \"It is a great advantage you have, friend Giskard, being able to weigh the emotional contents of minds. -But you said that Dr."},{"id":5044,"text":"Amadiro's flash of emotion at the trip to Earth was the second."},{"id":5045,"text":"What was the first?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The first came with the mention of the nuclear intensifier-and that, too, seems significant."},{"id":5046,"text":"The concept of, a nuclear intensifier is well known on Aurora."},{"id":5047,"text":"They don't have a portable device; not one light, enough and efficient enough to be practical on shipboard, but it's not something that would break upon him like a thunderbolt."},{"id":5048,"text":"Why, then, so much anxiety?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Possibly,\" said Daneel, \"because an intensifier of that sort has something to do with his plans on Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Possibly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it was at this point that the door opened, a person entered, and a voice said, \"Well--Giskard!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard looked at the newcomer and said in a calm voice, \"Madam Vasilia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You remember me, then,\" said Vasilia, smiling warmly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam."},{"id":5049,"text":"You are a well-known roboticist

passed into my hands?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"Madam Vasilia, it would not be possible to let this come before a court of law."},{"id":5113,"text":"Under the circumstances, I would surely be

take this to court."},{"id":5119,"text":"I am asking you for your own judgment."},{"id":5120,"text":"Would you not say that I am your rightful owner and have been since I was a very -young woman?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"Madam Gladia considers herself to be my owner and, until the law speaks to the contrary, she must be considered that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But you know that both she and the law labor under a misapprehension."},{"id":5121,"text":"If you worry about the feelings of your Solarian woman, it would be very easy to adjust her mindset so that she wouldn't mind your no longer being her property."},{"id":5122,"text":"You can even cause her to feel relieved that I will take you off her hands."},{"id":5123,"text":"I will order you to do so as soon as you can bring yourself to admit what you already know that I am your owner."},{"id":5124,"text":"How long has Daneel known your nature?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For decades, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You can make him

know.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said suddenly, \"Madam Vasilia, since Giskard does not consider himself your property, he can easily make you forget and you will then be perfectly content with matters as they are.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia turned a cold eye on Daneel. \"Can he?"},{"id":5128,"text":"But you see, it is not for you to decide who it is that Giskard considers his owner."},{"id":5129,"text":"I know that Giskard knows that I am his owner, so that his duty, within the Three Laws, belongs entirely to me."},{"id":5130,"text":"If he must make someone forget and can do so without physical harm, it will be necessary for him, in making a choice, to, choose anyone but me."},{"id":5131,"text":"He cannot make me forget or tamper with my mind in any way."},{"id":5132,"text":"I thank you, Daneel, for giving me the occasion of making this quite plain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"But Madam Gladia's emotions are so enwrapped in Giskard that for him to force forgetfulness upon her might harm her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia said, \"Giskard is the one to decide that. -Giskard, you are mine."},{"id":5133,"text":"You know you, are mine and I order you to induce forgetfulness in this man-aping robot who stands beside you and in the woman who wrongfully treated you as her property."},{"id":5134,"text":"Do it while she is asleep and there will be no harm done to her of any kind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Friend Giskard."},{"id":5135,"text":"Lady Gladia is your legal owner."},{"id":5136,"text":"If you induce forgetfulness in Lady Vasilia, it will not harm -her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But it will,\" said Vasilia at once. \"The Solarian woman will not be harmed, for she need only forget that she is under the impression that she is Giskard's owner."},{"id":5137,"text":"I, on the other hand, also know that Giskard has mental powers."},{"id":5138,"text":"Digging that out will be more complex and Giskard can surely tell by my intense determination to keep that knowledge that he could not help but inflict damage on me in the process of removing it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Friend Giskard---\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia said, in a voice that was diamond-hard, \"I order you, Robot Daneel Olivaw, to be silent."},{"id":5139,"text":"I am not your owner, but your owner is asleep and does not countermand it, so my order must be obeyed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel fell silent, but his lips trembled as though he were trying to talk despite the order,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia watched that manifestation with an amused smile on her lips. \"You see, Daneel, you cannot talk.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Daneel said in a hoarse whisper, \"I can, madam, I find it difficult, but I can, for I find that something takes precedence over your order, which is governed by only the Second Law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia's eyes opened wide and she said sharply, \"Silence, I say."},{"id":5140,"text":"Nothing takes precedence over my order but the First Law and I have already shown that Giskard will do least harm-indeed, no harm at all-if he returns to me."},{"id":5141,"text":"He will do harm to me, to whom he is least capable of doing harm, if he follows any other course of action.\" She pointed her finger at Daneel and said again with a soft hiss, \"Silence!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a clear effort for Daneel to make any sound at all."},{"id":5142,"text":"The small pump within him that manipulated the air current that produced the sound made a small, humming noise as it labored."},{"id":5143,"text":"Yet, though he spoke in an even lower whisper, he could still be heard."},{"id":5144,"text":"He said, \"Madam Vasilia, there is something that transcends even the First Law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, in a voice equally low, but unforced, \"Friend Daneel, you must not say that."},{"id":5145,"text":"Nothing transcends the First Law. \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia, frowning slightly, showed a spark of interest. \"Indeed?"},{"id":5146,"text":"Daneel, I warn you that if you attempt to progress further in this odd line of argument, you will surely destroy yourself."},{"id":5147,"text":"I have never seen or heard of a robot doing what you are doing and it would be fascinating to watch your self-destruction."},{"id":5148,"text":"Speak on.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the order given, Daneel's voice returned immediately to normal. \"I thank you, Madam Vasilia. -Years ago, I sat at the deathbed of an Earthman to whom you have asked me not to refer."},{"id":5149,"text":"May I now refer to him or do you know who it is that I speak of?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You speak of that policeman Baley,\" said Vasilia tonelessly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam."},{"id":5150,"text":"He said to me on his deathbed, 'The work of each individual contributes to a totality, and so becomes an undying part of the totality."},{"id":5151,"text":"That totality of human lives - past and present and to come-forms a tapestry that has been in existence now for many tens of thousands of years and has been growing more elaborate and, on the whole, more beautiful in all that time."},{"id":5152,"text":"Even the Spacers are an offshoot of the tapestry and they, too, add to the elaborateness and beauty of the pattern."},{"id":5153,"text":"An individual life is one thread in the tapestry and what is one thread compared to the whole?"},{"id":5154,"text":"Daneel, keep your mind fixed firmly on the tapestry and do not let the trailing off of a single thread affect you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mawkish sentimentality,\" murmured Vasilia."},{"id":5155,"text":"Daneel said, \"I believe Partner Elijah was attempting to protect me against the fact of his soon-to-come death."},{"id":5156,"text":"It was his own life he spoke of as but a thread in the tapestry-, it was his own life that was \"the trailing off of a single thread' that was not to affect me."},{"id":5157,"text":"His words did protect me in that crisis.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" said Vasilia, \"but get to the point of transcending the First Law, for it is that which will now destroy you."},{"id":5158,"text":"Daneel said, \"For decades I have brooded over Plainclothesman Elijah Baley's statement and it is quite likely I would have understood it at once if the Three Laws had not stood in the way."},{"id":5159,"text":"I have been helped in my search by my friend Giskard, who has long felt the Three Laws to be incomplete."},{"id":5160,"text":"I have been helped also by points Lady Gladia made in a recent speech on a Settler world."},{"id":5161,"text":"What's more this present crisis, Lady Vasilia, has served to sharpen my thinking."},{"id":5162,"text":"I am certain, now, as to the manner in which the Three Laws are incomplete.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A robot who is also a roboticist,\" said Vasilia with a touch of contempt. \"How are the Three Laws incomplete, robot?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"The tapestry of life is more important than a single thread."},{"id":5163,"text":"Apply that not to Partner Elijah alone, but generalize it and-and-and we conclude that humanity as a whole is more important than a single human being.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You stumble as you say it, robot."},{"id":5164,"text":"You do not believe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"There is a law that is greater than the First Law."},{"id":5165,"text":"A robot may not injure humanity or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm."},{"id":5166,"text":"I think of it now as the Zeroth Law of Robotics."},{"id":5167,"text":"The First Law should then be stated: 'A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm, unless this would violate the Zeroth Law of Robotics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia snorted. \"And you still stand on your feet, robot?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I still stand on my feet, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then I will explain something to you, robot, and we will see if you can survive the explanation. -The Three Laws of Robotics involve individual human beings and individual robots."},{"id":5168,"text":"You can point to any individual human being or to an individual robot."},{"id":5169,"text":"But what is your 'humanity\" but an abstraction?"},{"id":5170,"text":"Can you point to humanity?"},{"id":5171,"text":"You can injure or fail to injure a specific human being and understand the injury or lack of injury that has taken place."},{"id":5172,"text":"Can you see an injury to humanity?"},{"id":5173,"text":"Can you understand it?"},{"id":5174,"text":"Can you point to it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel was silent."},{"id":5175,"text":"Vasilia smiled broadly. \"Answer, robot."},{"id":5176,"text":"Can you see an injury to humanity and can you point to it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, madam, I cannot."},{"id":5177,"text":"But I believe such injury can exist nevertheless and you see that I still stand on my feet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then ask Giskard as to whether he will-or can-obey your Zeroth Law of Robotics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel's head turned to Giskard. \"Friend Giskard?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly Giskard said, \"I cannot accept the Zeroth Law, friend Daneel."},{"id":5178,"text":"You know that I have read widely in human history."},{"id":5179,"text":"In it, I have found great crimes committed by some human beings against each other and the excuse has always been that the crimes were justified by the needs of the tribe, or of the state, or even of humanity."},{"id":5180,"text":"It is precisely because humanity is an abstraction that it can be called upon so freely to justify anything at all and your Zeroth Law is therefore unsuitable."},{"id":5181,"text":"Daneel said, \"But you know, friend Giskard, the fact that a danger to humanity now exists and that it will surely come to fruition if you become the property of Madam Vasilia."},{"id":5182,"text":"That, at least, is not an abstraction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"The danger to which you refer is not something known, but is merely inferred."},{"id":5183,"text":"We cannot build our actions in defiance of the Three Laws on that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel paused, then said in a lower voice, \"But you hope that your studies of human history will help you develop the Laws governing human behavior, that you will learn to predict and guide human history-or at lease make a beginning, so that someone someday will learn to predict and guide it."},{"id":5184,"text":"You even call the, technique 'psychohistory.' In this, are you not dealing with the human tapestry?"},{"id":5185,"text":"Are you not trying - to work with humanity as a generalized whole, rather than with collections of individual human beings?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, friend Daneel, but it is thus far no more than a hope and I cannot base my actions upon a mere hope, nor can I modify the Three Laws in accordance with it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo that, Daneel did not respond."},{"id":5186,"text":"Vasilia said, \"Well, robot, all your attempts have come to nothing and yet you stand on your feet."},{"id":5187,"text":"You are strangely stubborn and a robot such as yourself that can denounce the Three Laws and still remain functional is a clear danger to every and any individual human being."},{"id":5188,"text":"For that reason, I believe you should be dismantled without delay."},{"id":5189,"text":"The case is too dangerous to await the slow majesty of the law, especially since you are, after all, a robot and not the human being you attempt to resemble.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Surely, my lady, it is not fitting for you to reach such a decision on your own.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have reached it nevertheless and if there are legal repercussions hereafter, I shall deal with them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You will be depriving Lady Gladia of a second robot and one to which you make no claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"She and Fastolfe, between them, have deprived me of my robot, Giskard, for more than twenty decades and I do not believe this ever distressed either of them for a moment it will not now distress me to deprive her."},{"id":5190,"text":"She has dozens of other robots and there are many here at the Institute who will faithfully see to her safety until she can return to her own.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Friend Giskard, if you will wake Lady Gladia, it may be that she may persuade Lady Vasilia--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia, looking at Giskard, frowned and said sharply, \"No, Giskard."},{"id":5191,"text":"Le the woman sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard, who had stirred at Daneel's words, subsided."},{"id":5192,"text":"Vasilia snapped the finger and thumb of her right hand three times and the door at once opened and four robots filed, in. \"You were right, Daneel."},{"id":5193,"text":"There are four robots."},{"id":5194,"text":"They will dismantle you and you are ordered not to resist."},{"id":5195,"text":"Thereafter Giskard and I will deal with all remaining matters."},{"id":5196,"text":"She looked over her shoulder at the entering robots. \"Close the door behind you."},{"id":5197,"text":"Now, quickly and efficiently, dismantle this robot,\" and she pointed at Daneel."},{"id":5198,"text":"The robots looked at Daneel and for a few seconds did not move."},{"id":5199,"text":"Vasilia said impatiently, \"I've told you he is a robot and you must disregard his human appearance."},{"id":5200,"text":"Daneel, tell them you are a robot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am a robot,\" said Daneel, \"and I will not resist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVasilia stepped to one side and the four robots advanced."},{"id":5201,"text":"Daneel's arms remained

weariness in his voice. \"Lady Gladia, later."},{"id":5217,"text":"I will explain."},{"id":5218,"text":"For now, we must hasten.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd they left."},{"id":5219,"text":"Amadiro bit his lower lip and his eyes flicked in the direction of Mandamus, who seemed lost in thought."},{"id":5220,"text":"Amadiro said defensively, \"She insisted on it."},{"id":5221,"text":"She told me that only she could handle this, Giskard, that only she could exert a sufficiently strong influence over him and prevent him from using these mental powers, of his.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You never said anything of this to me, Dr."},{"id":5222,"text":"Amadiro.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't sure what there was to tell, young man."},{"id":5223,"text":"I wasn't sure she was correct.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure now?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Completely."},{"id":5224,"text":"She remembers nothing of what went on-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So that we know nothing of what went on.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro nodded. \"Exactly."},{"id":5225,"text":"And she remembers nothing of what she had told me earlier.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And she's not acting?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I saw to it that she had an emergency

then?"},{"id":5228,"text":"We can take her account of Giskard as true and we know that he has the power to affect minds."},{"id":5229,"text":"That knowledge is crucial and it is now ours. -In fact, it is well that our roboticist colleague has failed."},{"id":5230,"text":"If Vasilia had gained control of that robot, how long do you suppose it would have been before you, too, would have been under her control-and I, -as well, assuming she would think I was worth controlling?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro nodded. \"I suppose she might have had something like that in mind."},{"id":5231,"text":"Right now, though, it's hard to tell what she has in mind."},{"id":5232,"text":"She seems, superficially at least, undamaged except for the specific loss of memory-she apparently remembers everything else-but who knows how this will affect her deeper thought processes and her skill as a roboticist?"},{"id":5233,"text":"That Giskard could do this to someone as skilled as she makes him an incredibly dangerous phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Does it occur to you, Dr."},{"id":5234,"text":"Amadiro, that the Settlers may be right in their distrust of robots?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It almost does, Mandamus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus rubbed his hands together. \"I assume from your depressed attitude that this whole business was not uncovered before they had time to leave

sharp, however, cannot make out actual words or ideas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure of that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So said Vasilia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"She may not have known what she was talking about."},{"id":5241,"text":"She did not, after all, manage to control the robot, as she said she was sure of doing."},{"id":5242,"text":"That's not much of a testimonial to her accuracy of understanding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yet I believe her in this."},{"id":5243,"text":"To actually be able to read thoughts would demand so much complexity in the positronic pathway pattern that it is totally unlikely that a child could have inserted it into the robot over twenty decades ago."},{"id":5244,"text":"It is actually far beyond even the present-day state of the art, Mandamus."},{"id":5245,"text":"Surely you must agree.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I would certainly think it was."},{"id":5246,"text":"And they're going to Earth?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Would this woman, brought up as she was, actually go to Earth?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"She has no choice if Giskard controls her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And why should Giskard want her to go to Earth?"},{"id":5247,"text":"Can he know about our project?"},{"id":5248,"text":"You seem to think he doesn't.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is possible he doesn't."},{"id":5249,"text":"His motivation for going to Earth might be nothing more than to place himself and the Solarian woman beyond our reach.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't think he'd fear us if he could handle Vasilia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A long-range weapon,\" said Amadiro icily, \"could bring him down."},{"id":5250,"text":"His own abilities must have a limited range."},{"id":5251,"text":"They can be based on nothing other than the electromagnetic field and he must be subject to the inverse square law."},{"id":5252,"text":"So we get out of range as the intensity of his powers weaken, but he will then find that he is not out of range of our weapons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus frowned and looked uneasy. \"You seem to have an un-Spacer liking for violence."},{"id":5253,"text":"Dr."},{"id":5254,"text":"Amadiro."},{"id":5255,"text":"In a cast like this, though, I suppose force would be permissible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A case like this?"},{"id":5256,"text":"A robot capable of harming human beings?"},{"id":5257,"text":"I should think so."},{"id":5258,"text":"We'll have to find a pretext for sending a good ship in pursuit."},{"id":5259,"text":"It wouldn't be wise to explain the actual situation-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mandamus emphatically. \"Think of how many would wish to have personal control of such a robot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Which we can't allow."},{"id":5260,"text":"And which is another reason why I would look upon destruction of the robot as the safer and preferable course of action.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You may be right,\" said Mandamus reluctantly, \"but I don't think it wise to count on this destruction only."},{"id":5261,"text":"I must go to Earth-now."},{"id":5262,"text":"The project must be hastened to its conclusion, even if we don't dot every 'I' and cross every 'T'.\" Once it is done, then it is done."},{"id":5263,"text":"Even a mind-handling robot-under anybody's control-will not be able to undo the deed."},{"id":5264,"text":"And if it does anything else, that, perhaps, will no longer matter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro said, \"Don't speak in the singular."},{"id":5265,"text":"I will go as well.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You?"},{"id":5266,"text":"Earth, is a horrible world."},{"id":5267,"text":"I must go, but why you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Because I must go, too."},{"id":5268,"text":"I cannot stay here any longer and wonder."},{"id":5269,"text":"You have not waited for this through a long lifetime as I have, Mandamus."},{"id":5270,"text":"You do not have the accounts to settle that I have."},{"id":5271,"text":"Gladia was in space again and once again Aurora could be made out as a globe."},{"id":5272,"text":"D.G."},{"id":5273,"text":"was busy elsewhere and the entire ship had about it a vague but pervasive air of emergency, as though it were on a battle footing, as though it were being pursued or expected pursuit."},{"id":5274,"text":"Gladia shook her head."},{"id":5275,"text":"She could think clearly; she felt well; but when her mind turned back to that time in the Institute, shortly after Amadiro had left her, a curiously pervasive unreality swept over her."},{"id":5276,"text":"There was a gap in time."},{"id":5277,"text":"One moment she had been sitting on the couch, feeling sleepy; the next there were four robots and a woman in the room who had not been there before."},{"id":5278,"text":"She had fallen asleep, then, but there was no awareness, no memory, that she had done so."},{"id":5279,"text":"There was a gap of nonexistence."},{"id":5280,"text":"Thinking back, she had recognized the woman after the fact."},{"id":5281,"text":"It was Vasilia Aliena-the daughter whom Gladia had replaced in the affections of Han Fastolfe."},{"id":5282,"text":"Gladia had never actually seen Vasilia, though she had viewed her on hyperwave several times."},{"id":5283,"text":"Gladia always thought of her as a distant and inimical other self."},{"id":5284,"text":"There was the vague similarity in appearance that others always commented on but that Gladia herself insisted she did not see-and there was the odd, antithetical connection with Fastolfe."},{"id":5285,"text":"Once they were on the ship and she was alone with her robots, she asked the inevitable question. \"What was Vasilia Aliena doing in the room and why was I permitted to sleep once she had arrived?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Madam Gladia, I will answer the question, since it is a matter friend Giskard would find difficult to discuss.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why should he find it difficult, Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Madam Vasilia arrived in the hope that she might persuade Giskard to enter her service.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Away from me?\" said Gladia in sharp indignation."},{"id":5286,"text":"She did not entirely like Giskard, but that made no difference."},{"id":5287,"text":"What was hers was hers. \"And you allowed me to sleep while you two handled the matter by yourselves?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We felt, madam, that you needed your sleep badly."},{"id":5288,"text":"Then, too, Madam Vasilia ordered us to allow you to sleep."},{"id":5289,"text":"Finally, it was our opinion that Giskard would not, in any case, join her service."},{"id":5290,"text":"For all these reasons, we did not wake you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia said indignantly, \"I should hope that Giskard would not for a moment consider leaving me."},{"id":5291,"text":"It would be illegal both by Auroran law and, more important, by the Three Laws of Robotics."},{"id":5292,"text":"It would be a good deed to return to Aurora and have her arraigned before the Court of Claims.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That would not be advisable at the moment, my lady.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What was her excuse for wanting Giskard?"},{"id":5293,"text":"Did she have one?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When she was a child, Giskard had been assigned to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Legally?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, madam."},{"id":5294,"text":"Dr."},{"id":5295,"text":"Fastolfe merely allowed her the use of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then she had no right to Giskard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We pointed that out, madam."},{"id":5296,"text":"Apparently, it was a matter of sentimental attachment on the part of Madam Vasilia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia sniffed. \"Having survived the loss of Giskard since before I came to Aurora, she might well have continued as she was without going to illegal lengths to deprive me of my property,\" -Then, restlessly, \"I should have been awakened.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Madam Vasilia had four robots with her."},{"id":5297,"text":"Had you been awake and had there been harsh words between the two of you, there might have been some difficulty in having the robots work out the proper responses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'd have directed the proper response, I assure you, Daneel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No doubt, madam."},{"id":5298,"text":"So might Madam Vasilia and she is one of the cleverest roboticists in the Galaxy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia shifted her attention to Giskard. \"And you have nothing to say?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Only that it was better as it was, my lady.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia looked thoughtfully into those faintly luminous robotic eyes, so different from Daneel's all-but-human ones, and it did seem to her that the incident wasn't very important after all."},{"id":5299,"text":"A small thing."},{"id":5300,"text":"And there were other things with which to be concerned."},{"id":5301,"text":"They were going to Earth."},{"id":5302,"text":"Somehow she did not think of Vasilia again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am concerned,\" said Giskard in his whisper of confidentiality in which sound waves barely trembled the air."},{"id":5303,"text":"The Settler ship was receding smoothly from Aurora and, as yet, there was no pursuit."},{"id":5304,"text":"The activity onboard had settled into routine and, with almost all routines automated, there was quiet and Gladia slept naturally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'm concerned for Lady Gladia, friend Daneel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel understood the characteristics of Giskard's positronic circuits well enough to need no long explanation."},{"id":5305,"text":"He said, \"It was necessary, friend Giskard, to adjust Lady Gladia."},{"id":5306,"text":"Had she questioned longer, she might have elicited the fact of your mental activities and adjustment would then have been more dangerous."},{"id":5307,"text":"Enough harm has already been done because Lady Vasilia discovered the fact."},{"id":5308,"text":"We do not know to whom-and to how many-she may have imparted her knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Giskard, \"I did not wish to make this adjustment."},{"id":5309,"text":"Had Lady Gladia wished to forget, it would have been a simple, no-risk adjustment."},{"id":5310,"text":"She wanted, however, with vigor and anger, to know more of the matter."},{"id":5311,"text":"She regretted not having played a greater role in it."},{"id":5312,"text":"I was forced, therefore, to break binding forces of considerable intensity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Even that was necessary, friend Giskard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yet the possibility of doing harm was by no means insignificant in such a case."},{"id":5313,"text":"If you think of a binding force as a thin, elastic cord-this is a poor analogy, but I can think of no other, for what I sense in, a mind has no analog outside the mind-then the ordinary inhibitions I deal with are so thin and insubstantial that they vanish when I touch them."},{"id":5314,"text":"A strong binding force, on the other hand, snaps and recoils when broken and the recoil may then break other, totally unrelated binding forces or, by whipping and coiling about other such forces, strengthen them, enormously."},{"id":5315,"text":"In either case, unintended changes can be brought about in a human being's emotions and attitudes and that would be almost certain to bring about harm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, his voice a little louder, \"Is it your impression you harmed Lady Gladia, friend Giskard?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I think not."},{"id":5316,"text":"I was extremely careful."},{"id":5317,"text":"I worked upon the matter during all the time you were talking to her."},{"id":5318,"text":"It was thoughtful of, you to bear the brunt of the conversation and to run the risk of being caught between an inconvenient truth and an untruth."},{"id":5319,"text":"But despite all my care, friend Daneel I took a risk and I am concerned that I was willing to take that risk."},{"id":5320,"text":"It came so close to violating the First Law that it required an extraordinary effort on my part to do it."},{"id":5321,"text":"I am sure that I would not have been able to do it-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, friend Giskard?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Had you not expounded your notion of the Zeroth Law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You accept it, then?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, I cannot."},{"id":5322,"text":"Can you?"},{"id":5323,"text":"Faced with the possibility of doing harm to an individual human being or of allowing harm to come to one, could you do the harm or allow the harm in the name of abstract humanity?"},{"id":5324,"text":"Think!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am not sure,\" said Daneel, voice trembling into all but silence."},{"id":5325,"text":"Then, with an effort, \"I might."},{"id":5326,"text":"The mere concept pushes at me-and at you."},{"id":5327,"text":"It helped you decide to take the risk in adjusting Lady Gladia's mind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it did,\" agreed Giskard, \"and the longer we think of the Zeroth Law, the more it might help push us."},{"id":5328,"text":"Could it do so, I wonder, in more than a marginal way, however?"},{"id":5329,"text":"Might it not only help us take slightly larger risks than we, might ordinarily?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yet I am convinced of the validity of the Zeroth Law, friend Giskard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So might I be if we could define what we mean by 'humanity.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a pause and Daneel said, \"Did you not accept the Zeroth Law, at last, when you stopped Madam Vasilia's robots and erased from her mind the knowledge of your mental powers?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"No, friend Daneel."},{"id":5330,"text":"Not really."},{"id":5331,"text":"I was tempted to accept it, but not really.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And yet your actions---\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Were dictated by a combination of motives."},{"id":5332,"text":"You told me of your concept of the Zeroth Law and it seemed to have a certain validity about it, but not sufficient to cancel the First Law or even to cancel Madam Vasilia's strong use of the Second Law in the orders she gave."},{"id":5333,"text":"Then, when you, called my attention to the application of the Zeroth Law to psychohistory, I could feel the positronomotive force mount higher and yet it was not quite high enough to supersede the First Law or even the strong Second Law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Still,\" murmured Daneel, \"you struck down Madam Vasilia, friend Giskard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When she ordered the robots to dismantle you, friend Daneel, and showed a clear emotion of pleasure at the prospect, your need, added to what the concept of the Zeroth Law had already done, superseded the Second Law and rivaled the First Law."},{"id":5334,"text":"It was the combination of the Zeroth Law, psychohistory, my loyalty to Lady Gladia, and your need that dictated my action.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My need could scarcely have affected you, friend Giskard."},{"id":5335,"text":"I am only a robot and though my need could affect my own actions by the Third Law, they cannot affect yours."},{"id":5336,"text":"You destroyed the overseer on Solaria without hesitation; you should have watched my destruction without being moved to act.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, friend Daneel, and ordinarily it might have been so."},{"id":5337,"text":"However, your mention of the Zeroth Law had reduced the First Law intensity to an abnormally low value."},{"id":5338,"text":"The necessity of saving you was sufficient to cancel out what remained of it and I acted as I did.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, friend Giskard."},{"id":5339,"text":"The prospect of injury to a robot should not have affected you at all."},{"id":5340,"text":"It should in no way have contributed to the overcoming of the First Law, however weak the First Law may have become.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is a strange thing, friend Daneel."},{"id":5341,"text":"I do not know how it came about."},{"id":5342,"text":"Perhaps it was because I have noted that you continue to think more and more like a, human being, but---\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, friend Giskard?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"At the moment when the robots advanced toward you and Lady Vasilia expressed her savage pleasure, my positronic pathway pattern re-formed in an anomalous fashion."},{"id":5343,"text":"For a moment, I thought of you-as a human being and I reacted accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That was wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I know that."},{"id":5344,"text":"And yet-and yet, if it were to happen again, I believe the same anomalous change would take place again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"It is strange, but hearing you put it so, I find myself feeling you did the proper thing."},{"id":5345,"text":"If the situation were reversed, I almost think that I, too, would-would do the same-that I would think of you as a-a human being.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel, hesitantly and slowly, put out his hand and Giskard looked at it uncertainly."},{"id":5346,"text":"Then, very slowly, he put out his own hand."},{"id":5347,"text":"The fingertips almost touched and then, little by little, each took the other's hand and clasped it almost as though they were the friends they called each

to say: \"Well, some star had to be the star,\" but she thought better of it. \"Very impressive,\" she said rather weakly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It's not merely impressive,\" said D.G., his eyes shadowed

supply Earth with energy."},{"id":5450,"text":"The nuclear explosions so induced would involve destruction through heat and mechanical force, through dust and radioactive products that would be thrown into the atmosphere."},{"id":5451,"text":"Even if this did not suffice to damage I Earth mortally, the destruction of Earth's energy supply would surely lead to the long-term collapse, of Earth's civilization.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said somberly, \"That is a horrifying thought and would seem to be an almost certain answer to the nature of the, crisis we seek."},{"id":5452,"text":"Why are you not satisfied, then?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have taken the liberty of using the ship's computer to obtain information concerning the planet Earth."},{"id":5453,"text":"The computer is, as one might expect on a Settler ship, rich in such information."},{"id":5454,"text":"It seems that Earth is the one human world that does not use microfusion reactors as a large-scale source of energy."},{"id":5455,"text":"It uses direct solar energy almost entirely, with solar power stations all, among the gestational orbit."},{"id":5456,"text":"There is nothing for a nuclear intensifier to do, except to destroy small devices- spaceships, occasional buildings."},{"id":5457,"text":"The damage might not be negligible, but it would not threaten Earth's existence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It may well be, friend Daneel, that Amadiro has some device that would destroy the solar power generators.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If so, why did he react to the mention of nuclear intensifiers?"},{"id":5458,"text":"There is no way they can serve against solar power generators.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard nodded slowly. \"That is a good point."},{"id":5459,"text":"And, to make another, if Dr."},{"id":5460,"text":"Amadiro was so horrified at the thought of our going to Earth, why did he make no effort to have us stopped while we were still on Aurora?"},{"id":5461,"text":"Or

made the Jump, friend Giskard."},{"id":5463,"text":"I sensed it some minutes ago."},{"id":5464,"text":"But we have not yet reached Earth and the interception you have just mentioned has, I suspect,

their heart."},{"id":5468,"text":"And that ship had detected the presence of D.G.'s vessel within fifteen minutes of its appearance in normal space and from a sizable distance, at

that a gathering and strengthening sense of loss.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Loss, friend Giskard?"},{"id":5723,"text":"Were you able to determine of what that loss might consist?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cannot describe my method of analysis of such things, but the loss did not seem to be the type of loss I have, in the past associated with generalities or with inanimate objects."},{"id":5724,"text":"It had the touch-that is not the word, but there is no other that fits even vaguely-of the loss of a specific person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Lady Gladia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That would be natural, friend Giskard."},{"id":5725,"text":"He was faced with the possibility of having to give her up to the Auroran vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It was too, intense for that."},{"id":5726,"text":"Too wailing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Too wailing?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is the only word I can think of in this connection."},{"id":5727,"text":"There was a stressful mourning associated with the sense of loss."},{"id":5728,"text":"It was not as though Lady Gladia would move elsewhere and be unavailable for that reason."},{"id":5729,"text":"That might, after all, be corrected at some future time."},{"id":5730,"text":"It was as though Lady Gladia would cease existing-would die-and be forever unavailable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He felt, then, that the Aurorans would kill her?"},{"id":5731,"text":"Surely that is not possible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, not possible."},{"id":5732,"text":"And that is not it."},{"id":5733,"text":"I felt a thread of a sense of personal responsibility associated with the deep, deep fear of loss."},{"id":5734,"text":"I searched other minds, on board ship and, putting it all together, I came to the suspicion that the captain was deliberately charging his ship into the Auroran vessel. \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That, too, is not possible, friend Giskard,\" said Daneel in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I had to accept it."},{"id":5735,"text":"My first impulse was to alter the captain's emotional makeup in such a way as to force him to change course, but I could not."},{"id":5736,"text":"His mind was so firmly set, so saturated with determination and-despite the suspense, tension, and dread of loss -so filled with confidence of success-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How could there be at once a dread of loss through death and a feeling of confidence of success?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Friend Daneel, I have given up marveling at the capacity of the human mind to maintain two opposing emotions simultaneously."},{"id":5737,"text":"I merely accept it."},{"id":5738,"text":"In this case, to have attempted to alter the captain's mind to the point of turning the ship from its course would have killed him."},{"id":5739,"text":"I could not do that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But if you did not, friend Giskard, scores of human beings on this ship, including Madam Gladia, and several hundreds more on the Auroran vessel would die.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They might not die if the captain were correct in his feeling of confidence in success."},{"id":5740,"text":"I could not bring about one certain death to prevent many merely probable ones."},{"id":5741,"text":"There is the difficulty, friend Daneel, in your Zeroth Law."},{"id":5742,"text":"The First Law deals with specific individuals and certainties."},{"id":5743,"text":"Your Zeroth Law deals with vague groups and probabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The human beings on board these ships are not vague groups."},{"id":5744,"text":"They are many specific individuals taken together.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yet when I must make a decision it is the specific individual I am about to influence directly whose fate must count with me."},{"id":5745,"text":"I cannot help that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What was it you did do, then, friend Giskard-or were you completely helpless?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In my desperation, friend Daneel, I attempted to contact the commander of the Auroran vessel after a small Jump had brought him quite close to us."},{"id":5746,"text":"I could not."},{"id":5747,"text":"The distance was too great."},{"id":5748,"text":"And yet the attempt was not altogether a failure."},{"id":5749,"text":"I did detect something, the equivalent of a faint hum."},{"id":5750,"text":"I puzzled over it a short while before realizing I was receiving the overall sensation of the minds of all the human beings on board the Auroran vessel."},{"id":5751,"text":"I had to filter out that faint hum from the much more prominent sensations arising from our own vessel-a difficult task.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Nearly impossible, I should think, friend, Giskard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As you say, nearly impossible, but I managed it with an enormous effort."},{"id":5752,"text":"However, try as I might, I could make out no individual minds. -When Madam Gladia faced the large numbers of human beings in her audience on Baleyworld, I sensed an anarchic confusion of a vast jumble of minds, but I managed to pick out individual minds here and there for a moment or two."},{"id":5753,"text":"That was not so on this occasion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard paused, as though lost in his memory of the sensation."},{"id":5754,"text":"Daneel said, \"I imagine this must be analogous to the manner in which we see individual stars even among large groups of them, when the whole is comparatively close to us."},{"id":5755,"text":"In a distant galaxy, however, we cannot make out individual stars but can see only a faintly luminous fog.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That strikes me as a good analogy, friend, Daneel. -And as I concentrated on the faint but distant hum, it seemed to me that I could detect a very dim wash of fear permeating it."},{"id":5756,"text":"I was not sure of this, but I felt I had to try to take advantage of it."},{"id":5757,"text":"I had never attempted to exert influence over anything so far, away, over anything as inchoate as a mere hum-but I tried desperately to increase that fear by however small a trifle."},{"id":5758,"text":"I cannot say whether I succeeded.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Auroran vessel fled."},{"id":5759,"text":"You must have succeeded.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not necessarily."},{"id":5760,"text":"The vessel might have fled if I had done nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel seemed lost in thought. \"It might."},{"id":5761,"text":"If our captain were so confident that it would flee----\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"On the other hand, I cannot be sure that there was a rational basis to that confidence."},{"id":5762,"text":"It seemed to me that what I detected was intermixed with a feeling of awe and reverence for Earth."},{"id":5763,"text":"The confidence I sensed was rather similar to the kind I have detected in young children toward their protectors-parental or otherwise."},{"id":5764,"text":"I had the feeling that the captain believed he could not fail in the neighborhood of Earth because of the influence of Earth."},{"id":5765,"text":"I wouldn't say the feeling was exactly irrational, but it felt nonrational, in any case.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You are undoubtedly right in this, friend Giskard."},{"id":5766,"text":"The captain has, in our hearing, spoken of Earth, on occasion, in a reverential manner, Since Earth cannot truly influence the success of an action through any mystical influence, it is quite possible to suppose that your influence was indeed successfully exerted."},{"id":5767,"text":"And moreover-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard, his eyes glowing dimly, said, \"Of what are you thinking, friend Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have been thinking of the supposition that the individual human being is concrete while humanity is abstract."},{"id":5768,"text":"When you detected that faint hum from the Auroran ship, you were not detecting an individual, but a portion of humanity."},{"id":5769,"text":"Could you not, if you were at a proper distance from Earth and if the background noise were sufficiently small, detect the hum of the mental activity of Earth's human population, overall?"},{"id":5770,"text":"And, extending that, can one not imagine that in the Galaxy generally there is the hum of the mental activity of all of humanity?"},{"id":5771,"text":"How, then, is humanity an abstraction?"},{"id":5772,"text":"It is something you can point to."},{"id":5773,"text":"Think of that in connection with the Zeroth Law and you will see that the extension of the Laws of Robotics is a justified one-justified by your own experience.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause and finally Giskard said, slowly as though it were being dragged out of him, \"You may be right friend Daneel. -And yet, if we are landing on Earth now, with a Zeroth Law we may be able to use, we still don't know how we might use it."},{"id":5774,"text":"It seems to us, so far, that the crisis that Earth faces involves the use of a nuclear intensifier, but as far as we know, there is nothing of significance on Earth on which a nuclear intensifier can do its work."},{"id":5775,"text":"What, then, will we do on Earth?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do not as yet know,\" said Daneel sadly."},{"id":5776,"text":"Noise!"},{"id":5777,"text":"Gladia listened in astonishment."},{"id":5778,"text":"It didn't hurt her ears."},{"id":5779,"text":"It wasn't the sound of surface slashing on surface."},{"id":5780,"text":"It wasn't a piercing shriek, or a clamor, or a banging, or -anything that could be expressed by an onomatopoetic word."},{"id":5781,"text":"It was softer and less overwhelming, rising and falling, bearing within it an occasional irregularity -and always there."},{"id":5782,"text":"D.G."},{"id":5783,"text":"watched her listening, cocking her head to this side and that, and said, \"I call it the 'Drone of the City,' Gladia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Does it ever stop?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Never, really, but what can you expect?"},{"id":5784,"text":"Haven't you ever stood in a field and heard the wind rustling the leaves and insects stridulating and birds calling, and water running."},{"id":5785,"text":"That never stops.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That's different.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, it isn't."},{"id":5786,"text":"It's the same."},{"id":5787,"text":"The sound here is the melting together of the rumble of machinery and the various noises people make, but the principle is precisely the same as the natural nonhuman noises of a field."},{"id":5788,"text":"You're used to fields, so you don't hear the noise there."},{"id":5789,"text":"You're not used to this, so you hear it and probably find it

it."},{"id":5791,"text":"Tomorrow you won't hear it either.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia looked about thoughtfully from their position on a small balcony. \"So many buildings!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That's true enough."},{"id":5792,"text":"Structures in every direction stretching outward for miles."},{"id":5793,"text":"And up-and down, too."},{"id":5794,"text":"This is not just a city, in the fashion of Aurora or Baleyworld."},{"id":5795,"text":"It is a City -capital 'C' -of the kind that exists only on Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"These are the Caves of Steel,\" said Gladia. \"I

with the soft and universal lights of fluorescents making everything seem bathed in soft shadowless sunshine-but it isn't sunshine and, up above the surface, I don't know if the sun is really shining at the moment, or is covered by clouds, or is absent altogether, leaving this part of the world plunged, in night and darkness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It makes the City enclosed."},{"id":5801,"text":"People breathe each other's air.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We do anyway-on any world- anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not like this.\" She sniffed. \"It

\"Horrible!"},{"id":5807,"text":"What's the name of this City, D.G.?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It's New York."},{"id":5808,"text":"It's the chief City, but not the, largest."},{"id":5809,"text":"On this

will get a guide and we'll really see the City.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Will we have any trouble taking my robots with us?\" She gestured toward Daneel and Giskard at the other end of the room. \"I don't mind being without them when I'm with you on the ship, but if I'm going to be with crowds of strangers I'll feel more secure having them with me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There'll be no problem with Daneel,

in theory, not be allowed inside the city borders, but they've made an exception in his case and I hope they will continue to do so."},{"id":5841,"text":"It is too bad, in a way, that we must wait here and can't step outside.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You say I should not be exposed to all that noise just yet,\" said Gladia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, no."},{"id":5842,"text":"I'm not referring to the public squares and roadways."},{"id":5843,"text":"I would just like to take you out into the corridors within this particular building."},{"id":5844,"text":"There are miles and miles of them literally -and they're a small bit of City in themselves: shopping recesses, dining halls, amusement areas, Personals, elevators, transways, and so on."},{"id":5845,"text":"There's more color and variety on one

her, not only from the crowds on the other side of the police lines, but from D.G."},{"id":5883,"text":"and from her two robots."},{"id":5884,"text":"It also subjected her to a kind of polite jostling

the crowds and the procession for the few moments they remained in sight."},{"id":5894,"text":"Then the ground-car plunged downward under the Expressway, through a short tunnel that in no way

endless succession of them came up to speak to Gladia."},{"id":5899,"text":"The word had apparently gone out not to offer to shake hands, but some inevitably did, and, trying not to hesitate, Gladia would briefly place two fingers on the hand and then withdraw them."},{"id":5900,"text":"Eventually, a number of women prepared to leave for the nearest Personal and one of them performed what was obviously a social ritual and tactfully asked Gladia if she would like to accompany them."},{"id":5901,"text":"Gladia didn't, but there might be a long night ahead and might be more embarrassing to have to interrupt it later."},{"id":5902,"text":"Within the Personal, there was the usual excited laughing and chattering and Gladia, bowing to the exigencies of the situation and fortified by her experience that morning, made use of the facilities in a small chamber with partitions on either side, but with none in front of her."},{"id":5903,"text":"No one seemed to mind and Gladia tried to remind herself she must adjust to local customs."},{"id":5904,"text":"At least the place was well-ventilated and seemed spotlessly clean."},{"id":5905,"text":"Though out, Daneel and Giskard had been ignored."},{"id":5906,"text":"This, Gladia realized, was a kindness."},{"id":5907,"text":"Robots were no longer allowed within City limits, though there were millions in the countryside without."},{"id":5908,"text":"To have made a point of the presence of Daneel and Giskard would have meant raising the legal, issue that involved."},{"id":5909,"text":"It was easier to pretend, tactfully, that they weren't there."},{"id":5910,"text":"Once the banquet began, they sat quietly at a table with D.G., not too far removed from the dais."},{"id":5911,"text":"At the dais, Gladia sat, eating sparingly and wondering if the food would give her dysentery."},{"id":5912,"text":"D.G., perhaps not entirely pleased with his relegation to the post of keeper of the robots, kept staring restlessly in Gladia's direction and, occasionally, she lifted one hand and smiled at him."},{"id":5913,"text":"Giskard, equally watchful of Gladia, had an opportunity to say to Daneel very quietly, under cover of the relentless and unending background clash of cutlery and babble, \"Friend Daneel, these are -high officials that sit -here in this room."},{"id":5914,"text":"It is possible that one or more may have information of use to us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is possible, friend Giskard."},{"id":5915,"text":"Can you, thanks to your abilities, guide me in this respect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cannot."},{"id":5916,"text":"The mental background yields me no specific emotional response of interest."},{"id":5917,"text":"Nor does the occasional flash among the nearest show me anything."},{"id":5918,"text":"Yet the climax of the crisis is, I am certain, approaching quickly, even as we sit here, idle.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said gravely, \"I will try to do as Partner Elijah would- have done and force the pace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel was not eating."},{"id":5919,"text":"He watched the assemblage with his calm eyes and located the one he was searching for."},{"id":5920,"text":"Quietly, he rose and moved toward another table, his eyes on a woman who was managing to eat briskly and yet maintain a cheerful conversation with the man on her left."},{"id":5921,"text":"She was a stocky woman, with short hair that showed definite traces of gray."},{"id":5922,"text":"Her face, if not youthful, was pleasant."},{"id":5923,"text":"Daneel waited for a natural break in the conversation and when that did not I come, he said with an effort, \"Madam, may I interrupt?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe looked up at -him, startled and plainly displeased. \"Yes,\" she said rather briskly, \"what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said Daneel, \"I ask your pardon for this interruption, but may I have your permission to speak with you for a time?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe stared at him, frowning for a moment, and then her expression softened."},{"id":5924,"text":"She said, \"I should guess, from your excessive politeness, that you're the robot, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am one of Madam Gladia's robots, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but you're the human one."},{"id":5925,"text":"You're R."},{"id":5926,"text":"Daneel Olivaw.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That is my name, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe woman turned to the man on her left and said, \"Please excuse me."},{"id":5927,"text":"I can't very well refuse this-robot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHer neighbor smiled uncertainly and transferred his attention to the place before him."},{"id":5928,"text":"The woman said to Daneel, \"If you have a chair, why don't you bring it here?"},{"id":5929,"text":"I will be glad to speak to you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Daneel had returned and seated himself, she said, \"You are really R."},{"id":5930,"text":"Daneel Olivaw, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That is my name, madam,\" said Daneel, again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I mean the one who worked with Elijah Baley long ago.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You're not a new model of the same line?"},{"id":5931,"text":"You're not R."},{"id":5932,"text":"Daneel the Fourth or something like that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Mere is little of me that has not been replaced in the past twenty decades-or even modernized and improved but my positronic brain is the same as it was when I worked with Partner Elijah on three different worlds-and once on a spaceship."},{"id":5933,"text":"It has not been altered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" She looked at -him admiringly. \"You're certainly a good job."},{"id":5934,"text":"If all robots were like you, I'd see no objection to them whatever. -What is it you want to talk to me about?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When you were introduced to Lady Gladia, madam, before we all took our seats, you were presented to her as the Undersecretary of Energy, Sophia Quintana.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You remember well."},{"id":5935,"text":"That is my name and my office.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Does the office refer to all of Earth or merely to the city?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'm Global Undersecretary, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then you are knowledgeable in the field of energetics?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuintana smiled."},{"id":5936,"text":"She did not seem to object to being questioned."},{"id":5937,"text":"Perhaps she thought it amusing or perhaps she found herself attracted to Daneel's air of deferential gravity or to the mere fact that a robot could question her so."},{"id":5938,"text":"In any case, she said with a smile, \"I majored in energetics at the University of California and have a master's degree in it."},{"id":5939,"text":"As to how knowledgeable I still am, I'm not certain."},{"id":5940,"text":"I've spent too many years as an administrator something that saps one's brains, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But you would be well acquainted with the practical aspects of Earth's present energy supply, would you not?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes."},{"id":5941,"text":"That I will admit to."},{"id":5942,"text":"Is there something you want to know about it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There is something that piques my curiosity, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Curiosity?"},{"id":5943,"text":"In a robot?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel bowed his head. \"If a robot is complex enough, he can be, aware of something within himself that seeks information."},{"id":5944,"text":"This is analogous to what I have observed to be called 'curiosity' in human beings and I take the liberty of using the same word in connection with my own feelings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Fair enough."},{"id":5945,"text":"What are you curious about, R."},{"id":5946,"text":"Daneel?"},{"id":5947,"text":"May I call you that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam."},{"id":5948,"text":"I understand that Earth's energy supply is drawn from solar power stations in geostationary orbit in Earth's equatorial plane.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You understand correctly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But are these power stations the sole energy supply of, this planet?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo."},{"id":5949,"text":"They are the primary-but not the sole-energy supply."},{"id":5950,"text":"There is considerable use of energy from Earth's internal heat, from winds, waves, tides, flowing water, and so on."},{"id":5951,"text":"We have quite a complex mix and each variety has its advantages."},{"id":5952,"text":"Solar energy is the mainstay, however.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You make no mention of nuclear energy, madam."},{"id":5953,"text":"Are there no uses for microfusion?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuintana raised her eyebrows. \"Is that what you're curious about, R."},{"id":5954,"text":"Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam."},{"id":5955,"text":"What is the reason for the absence of nuclear power sources on Earth?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They are not absent, R."},{"id":5956,"text":"Daneel."},{"id":5957,"text":"On a small scale, one comes across it."},{"id":5958,"text":"Our robots-we have many in the countryside, you know-are micro fusionized."},{"id":5959,"text":"Are you, by the way?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Yes, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then, too,\" she went on, \"there are microfusionized machines here and there, but the total is quite trifling.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is it not true, Madam Quintana, that microfusion energy sources are sensitive to the action of nuclear intensifiers?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They certainly are."},{"id":5960,"text":"Yes, of course."},{"id":5961,"text":"The microfusion power source will blow up and I suppose that comes under the heading of being sensitive.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then it isn't possible for someone, using a nuclear intensifier, to seriously cripple some crucial portion of Earth's energy supply.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuintana laughed. \"No, of course not."},{"id":5962,"text":"In the first place, I don't see anyone dragging a nuclear intensifier about from place to place."},{"id":5963,"text":"They weigh tons and I don't think they can be maneuvered through and along the streets and corridors of a City."},{"id":5964,"text":"Certainly, it would be noticed if anyone tried."},{"id":5965,"text":"And then, even if a nuclear intensifier were brought into play, all it could do would be to destroy a few robots and a few machines before the thing would be discovered and stopped."},{"id":5966,"text":"There is no chance at all-zero-of our being hurt in that way."},{"id":5967,"text":"Is that the reassurance you wanted, R."},{"id":5968,"text":"Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was almost a dismissal."},{"id":5969,"text":"Daneel said, \"There are just one or two small points I would like clarified, Madam Quintana."},{"id":5970,"text":"Why is there no large microfusion source on Earth?"},{"id":5971,"text":"The Spacer worlds all depend on microfusion and so do all the Settler worlds."},{"id":5972,"text":"Microfusion is portable, versatile, and cheap-and doesn't require the enormous effort of maintenance, repair, and replacement that space structures do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And, as you said, R."},{"id":5973,"text":"Daneel, they are sensitive to nuclear intensifiers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And, as you said, Madam Quintana, nuclear intensifiers are too large and bulky to be of much use.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuintana smiled broadly and nodded. \"You are very intelligent, R."},{"id":5974,"text":"Daneel,\" she said. \"It never occurred to me that I would ever sit at a table and carry on a discussion like this with a robot."},{"id":5975,"text":"Your Auroran roboticists are very clever too clever-for I fear to carry on this discussion."},{"id":5976,"text":"I'd have to worry about you taking my Place in the government."},{"id":5977,"text":"You, know, we do have a legend about a robot named Stephen Byerly taking a high post in the government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That must be merely fiction, Madam Quintana,\" said Daneel gravely. \"There are no robots in governmental posts on any of the Spacer worlds."},{"id":5978,"text":"We are merely -robots.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'm relieved to hear that and will therefore go on."},{"id":5979,"text":"The matter of differences in power sources has its roots in history."},{"id":5980,"text":"At the time that hyperspatial travel was developed, we had microfusion, so that people leaving Earth took microfusion power sources with them."},{"id":5981,"text":"It was necessary on spaceships and on planets, too, in the generations during which they were being adapted for human occupation."},{"id":5982,"text":"It takes many years to build an adequate complex of solar power, stations-and rather than undertake such a task, the emigrants remained with microfusion."},{"id":5983,"text":"So it was with the Spacer's in their time, and so it is now with the Settlers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On Earth, however, microfusion and solar power in space were developed at roughly the same time and both, were used more and more."},{"id":5984,"text":"Finally, we could make -our choice and use either microfusion or solar power or, of course, both."},{"id":5985,"text":"And we chose solar power.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"That seems strange to me, Madam Quintana."},{"id":5986,"text":"Why not both?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Actually, that's not a very difficult question to answer, R."},{"id":5987,"text":"Daneel."},{"id":5988,"text":"Earth, in prehyperspatial days, had had experience with a primitive form of nuclear energy, and it wasn't a happy experience."},{"id":5989,"text":"When the time came to choose between solar power and microfusion, Earthpeople saw microfusion as a form of nuclear energy and turned away from it."},{"id":5990,"text":"Other worlds, which did not have our direct experience with the primitive form of, nuclear energy, had no reason to turn away from microfusion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"May I ask what this primitive form of nuclear energy to which you refer might be, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Uranium fission,\" said Quintana. \"It's completely different from microfusion."},{"id":5991,"text":"Fission involves the splitting of massive nuclei, such as those of uranium."},{"id":5992,"text":"Microfusion involves the Joining of light nuclei, such as those of hydrogen."},{"id":5993,"text":"They're both forms of nuclear energy, however.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I presume that uranium would be the fuel for fission devices.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes-or other massive nuclei, such as those of thorium or plutonium.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But uranium and these others are exceedingly rare metals."},{"id":5994,"text":"Could they support a fission-using society?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Those elements are rare on other worlds."},{"id":5995,"text":"On Earth, they are not exactly common, but neither are they terribly rare."},{"id":5996,"text":"Uranium and thorium are widely spread in the crust in small quantities and are concentrated in a few places.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And are there any fission-power devices on Earth now, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Quintana flatly. \"Nowhere and in no fashion."},{"id":5997,"text":"Human beings would far sooner burn oil-or even wood than fission uranium."},{"id":5998,"text":"The very word 'uranium' is taboo in polite society."},{"id":5999,"text":"You wouldn't be asking me these questions or, I giving you these answers if you were a human being and an Earthman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel persisted. \"But are you certain, madam?"},{"id":6000,"text":"Is there no secret device that makes use of fission that, for the sake of national security---\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, robot,\" said Quintana, frowning. \"I tell you-no such device."},{"id":6001,"text":"None!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel rose. \"I thank you, madam, and I ask your pardon for taking your time and for probing what would seem to be a sensitive subject."},{"id":6002,"text":"With your permission, I shall leave you now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuintana waved a careless hand. \"You're welcome, R."},{"id":6003,"text":"Daneel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe turned again to her neighbor, secure in the knowledge that in the crowds of Earth, people never attempted to overhear a nearby conversation or, if they did, never admitted the fact."},{"id":6004,"text":"She said, \"Would ~ you imagine having a discussion on energetics with a robot?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for Daneel, he returned to his original place and said softly to Giskard, \"Nothing, friend Giskard."},{"id":6005,"text":"Nothing helpful.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he added sadly, \"Perhaps I asked the wrong questions."},{"id":6006,"text":"Partner Elijah would have asked the right one's.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary-General Edgar Andrev, chief executive of Earth, was a rather tall and imposing man, clean-shaven in the Spacer style."},{"id":6007,"text":"He moved always in a measured fashion, as though on constant display, and he had a twinkling way about him as though he was always very pleased with himself."},{"id":6008,"text":"His voice was a bit too high-pitched for his body but it fell well short of being squeaky."},{"id":6009,"text":"Without seeming obdurate, he was not easily swayed."},{"id":6010,"text":"And he wasn't this time. \"Impossible,\" he said firmly to D.G. \"She must make her appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"She's had a hard day, Secretary-General,\" said DI.G. \"She is not accustomed to crowds or to these surroundings."},{"id":6011,"text":"I am responsible to Baleyworld for her well-being and my personal honor is at stake.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate your position,\" said Andrev, \"but I represent, and I cannot deny Earthpeople their view of her."},{"id":6012,"text":"The corridors are filled, the hyperwave channels are ready, and I would not be able to hide her, even if I desperately wished to do so."},{"id":6013,"text":"After this-and how long can it last?"},{"id":6014,"text":"Half an hour? -She can retire and she need not I make another appearance till her speech tomorrow night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Her comfort must be cared for,\" said D.G., tacitly abandoning his position. \"She has to be kept at some distance from the crowd.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There will be a cordon of security guards that will give her ample breathing space."},{"id":6015,"text":"The front row of the crowd will be kept well back."},{"id":6016,"text":"They're out there now."},{"id":6017,"text":"If we don't announce that she will soon appear, there might well be disorder."},{"id":6018,"text":"D.G."},{"id":6019,"text":"said, \"It shouldn't have been arranged."},{"id":6020,"text":"It isn't safe."},{"id":6021,"text":"There are Earthpeople who aren't fond of Spacers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Secretary-General shrugged. \"I wish you could tell me how I could possibly have kept it from being arranged."},{"id":6022,"text":"At the present moment she is a heroine and she cannot be withheld."},{"id":6023,"text":"Nor will anyone offer her anything but cheers for the moment."},{"id":6024,"text":"But if she doesn't appear, that will change."},{"id":6025,"text":"Now, let us go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD.G."},{"id":6026,"text":"backed away discontentedly."},{"id":6027,"text":"He caught Gladia's eye."},{"id":6028,"text":"She looked tired and more than a little unhappy."},{"id":6029,"text":"He said, \"You must, Gladia."},{"id":6030,"text":"There's no way out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment, she stared down at her hands as though wondering if they could do anything to protect her, then she straightened herself and lifted her chin-a small Spacer amid this horde of barbarians. \"If I must, I must."},{"id":6031,"text":"Will you remain with me?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Unless they remove me physically.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And my robots?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD.G."},{"id":6032,"text":"hesitated. \"Gladia, how will two robots be able to

of mine."},{"id":6034,"text":"But not just yet, please."},{"id":6035,"text":"For the moment, I will feel safer with them, whether that makes sense or not."},{"id":6036,"text":"If these Earth, officials want me to acknowledge the crowd, to smile, to wave, to do whatever it is I am supposed to do, the presence of Daneel and Giskard will comfort me. -Look, D.G., giving in to them on a very big thing, even though I am so uneasy that I think nothing would be so nice as to run away."},{"id":6037,"text":"Let them give in to me on this very little thing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'll try,\" said D.G., in clear discouragement and, as he stepped toward Andrev, Giskard moved quietly with him."},{"id":6038,"text":"A few minutes later, when Gladia, surrounded by a carefully picked contingent of officials, moved forward toward an open balcony, D.G."},{"id":6039,"text":"remained a little behind Gladia, flanked on his left by Giskard and on his right by Daneel."},{"id":6040,"text":"The,

his right temple."},{"id":6042,"text":"For some reason he caught Giskard's eye and turned away with a stifled shudder. \"But you must keep them motionless, Captain, remember."},{"id":6043,"text":"And please keep the one that looks like a robot as unobtrusive as you can."},{"id":6044,"text":"He makes me uneasy and I don't want people any more aware of him than they have to

waspishly."},{"id":6047,"text":"He paused to take a message capsule someone placed in his hand."},{"id":6048,"text":"He put it into his pocket, then walked on and didn't think of it again till they had reached the balcony."},{"id":6049,"text":"To Gladia, it seemed that each time she moved into another scene, it grew worse -more people, more noise, more confusing light, more invasion of every sense perception."},{"id":6050,"text":"There was shouting."},{"id":6051,"text":"She could hear her own name being shouted out."},{"id":6052,"text":"With difficulty, she overcame her own tendency to retreat and become immobile."},{"id":6053,"text":"She lifted her arm and waved it and smiled and the shouting became louder, Someone began to speak, his voice booming out over the loudspeaker system, his image on a large screen high above them so that it could be visible to all the crowd."},{"id":6054,"text":"Undoubtedly, it was also visible on innumerable screens in innumerable meeting halls in every Section of every City on the planet."},{"id":6055,"text":"Gladia sighed with relief at having someone else in the spotlight."},{"id":6056,"text":"She tried to shrink within herself and let the sound of the speaker distract the attention of the crowd."},{"id":6057,"text":"Secretary-General Andrev, seeking cover under the voice, even as Gladia did, was rather thankful that, in giving precedence to Gladia, it had not seemed necessary for him to speak on this occasion."},{"id":6058,"text":"He suddenly remembered the message h(r had pocketed."},{"id":6059,"text":"He frowned in sudden disturbance over what it might be that warranted the interruption of so important a ceremony and then experienced a reverse feeling of intense irritation over the fact that it would probably prove to

removed the thin piece of plastipaper, read the message it contained, and then watched it crumble and -fragment."},{"id":6062,"text":"He brushed away the impalpable powder that remained and gestured

most possessive arm about Gladia's shoulder, said in an angry rumble, \"An Auroran robot, specially programmed-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, D.G.,\" said Gladia. \"No way."},{"id":6167,"text":"Auroran or not, special programming or not, a robot cannot deliberately try to harm, a human being it knows to be a human being."},{"id":6168,"text":"If this robot did fire the blaster in my direction, he

its orders must have felt that the attempt would be enough to disrupt my plans here on Earth and it was the disruption they were after."},{"id":6169,"text":"They couldn't order the robot to kill me,

do we do?"},{"id":6174,"text":"The knowledge that a humanoid robot used a blaster in a crowd of human beings will not be taken well by Earth people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Obviously, it wouldn't,\" said D.G. \"Therefore, let's not tell them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A number of people must already know -or guess that we are dealing with a robot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You won't stop the rumor,

to-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not Aurora,\" said Gladia quickly. \"Merely certain people on Aurora, certain fire-eaters."},{"id":6175,"text":"There are such bellicose extremists among the Settlers, too, I

beings on both sides and nothing must be done to weaken that appeal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel, who had been waiting patiently, finally found a pause long enough to make it possible for him to insert his comment. \"Madam Gladia-sirs-it is important to find out from this robot where on this planet he is based."},{"id":6178,"text":"There may be others.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you asked him?\" said Andrev.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have, Secretary-General, but I am a robot."},{"id":6179,"text":"This robot is not required to answer questions put to him by another robot."},{"id":6180,"text":"Nor is

done."},{"id":6183,"text":"Madam Gladia, would you inquire as to where his planetary base might be?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said in a low voice, so that only Daneel heard him, \"It may not be possible."},{"id":6184,"text":"He may have been ordered into irreversible freeze if the questioning becomes too insistent."},{"id":6185,"text":"Daneel's head turned sharply to Giskard."},{"id":6186,"text":"He whispered, \"Can you prevent that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Uncertain,\" said Giskard. \"The brain has been physically damaged by the act of firing a blaster toward human

faced the robot assassin, drew a deep breath, and in a voice that was firm yet soft and gentle, she said, \"Robot, how may I address you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe robot said, \"I am referred to as R."},{"id":6187,"text":"Ernett Second, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ernett, can you tell that I am an Auroran?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You speak in the Auroran fashion, yet not entirely,

master."},{"id":6190,"text":"Any question at all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do you understand that if you do not answer I will be bitterly disappointed and that my rightful expectation of robotic service

not inflect damage on me, Ernett, by refusing to tell me the location of your base on this planet."},{"id":6193,"text":"I order you to tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe robot seemed to stiffen."},{"id":6194,"text":"His mouth opened but made no sound."},{"id":6195,"text":"It opened again and he whispered huskily, \"...mile...\" It opened a third time silently-and then, while the

and it might have been making nothing more than random sounds."},{"id":6214,"text":"It is useless to try to extract meaning from something that doesn't contain it. -And now I want to make sure that Madam Gladia gets some rest or that she is at least moved out of this room before the rest of the ceiling comes down."},{"id":6215,"text":"They moved out quickly and Daneel, lingering behind for a moment, said softly to Giskard, \"Again we fail!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City never grew entirely quiet, but there were periods when the lights were dimmer, the noise of the ever moving Expressways was subdued, and the endless clatter of machinery and humanity subsided just a bit."},{"id":6216,"text":"In several million apartments people slept."},{"id":6217,"text":"Gladia got into bed in the apartment assigned to her, uncomfortable over the missing amenities that she feared might force her out into the corridors during the night."},{"id":6218,"text":"Was it night on the surface, she wondered just before falling asleep, or was it merely an arbitrary \"sleep period\" fixed within this particular cave of steel, in deference to a habit developed over the hundreds of millions of years that human beings and their ancestors had lived on the surface of the land."},{"id":6219,"text":"And then she slept."},{"id":6220,"text":"Daneel and Giskard did not sleep."},{"id":6221,"text":"Daneel, finding there was a computer outlet in the apartment, spent an absorbed half-hour learning the unfamiliar key combinations by hit-and-miss."},{"id":6222,"text":"There were no instructions of any sort available (who needs instructions for what every youngster learns in grade school?) but, fortunately, the controls, while not the same I as those of Aurora, were not wholly different either."},{"id":6223,"text":"Eventually, he was able to tune into the reference section of the City library and call up the encyclopedia."},{"id":6224,"text":"Hours passed."},{"id":6225,"text":"At the lowest depth of the humans sleep period, Giskard said, \"Friend Daneel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel looked up. \"Yes, friend Giskard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I must ask for an explanation of your actions on the balcony.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Friend Giskard, you looked toward the crowd."},{"id":6226,"text":"I followed your glance, saw a weapon aimed in your direction, and reacted at once.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"So you did, friend Daneel, and given certain assumptions, I can understand why it was me that you lunged forward to protect."},{"id":6227,"text":"Begin with the fact that the would-be assassin was a robot."},{"id":6228,"text":"In that case, however it might be programmed, it could not aim its weapon at any human being with the intention of hitting him or her."},{"id":6229,"text":"I Nor was it likely to aim it's weapon at you, for you look enough like a human being to activate the First Law."},{"id":6230,"text":"Even if the robot had been told that a humanoid robot would be on the balcony, he could not be certain that you were he."},{"id":6231,"text":"Therefore, if the robot intended to destroy someone in, the balcony, it could only be me-the obvious robot and you acted at once to protect me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Or begin with the fact that the assassin was an Auroran whether human or robot does not matter."},{"id":6232,"text":"Dr, Amadiro is most likely to have ordered such an attack, since he is an extremist in his anti-Earth stand and, we believe, is plotting its destruction."},{"id":6233,"text":"Dr."},{"id":6234,"text":"Amadiro, we can be reasonably certain, has learned of my special abilities from Madam Vasilia and it might be argued that he would give my destruction top priority, since he would naturally fear me more than anyone priori else-robot or human."},{"id":6235,"text":"Reasoning this out, it would be logical for you to act as you did to protect me."},{"id":6236,"text":"And, indeed, had you not knocked me down, I believe the blast would have destroyed me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But, friend Daneel, you could not possibly have known that the assassin was a robot or that he was Auroran."},{"id":6237,"text":"I myself had only just caught the strange anomaly of a robotic brain pattern against, the vast blur of human emotion when you struck me-and it was only after that, that I had the chance of informing you."},{"id":6238,"text":"Without my ability, you could only be aware that a weapon was being aimed by what you must naturally have -thought of as a human being and an Earthperson."},{"id":6239,"text":"The logical target, then, was Madam Gladia, as, in fact, everyone on the balcony assumed it to be."},{"id":6240,"text":"Why, then, did you ignore Madam Gladia and protect me, instead?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Friend Giskard, consider my line of thought."},{"id":6241,"text":"The Secretary-General had said that a two-man Auroran landing module had come to Earth's surface."},{"id":6242,"text":"I assumed at once that Dr."},{"id":6243,"text":"Amadiro and Dr."},{"id":6244,"text":"Mandamus had come to Earth."},{"id":6245,"text":"For this, there could be only one reason."},{"id":6246,"text":"The plan they have, whatever its nature, is at-or very nearly at the point of maturity."},{"id":6247,"text":"Now that you have come to Earth, friend Giskard, they

if they could."},{"id":6249,"text":"Therefore, when I saw an aimed weapon, I moved at once to force you out of the line of fire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"The First Law should have forced you to move Madam Gladia out of the line of fire."},{"id":6250,"text":"No thought, no reasoning, should have altered that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, friend Giskard."},{"id":6251,"text":"You are more important than Madam Gladia-is is."},{"id":6252,"text":"You are, in fact, more important than any human being could be at this moment."},{"id":6253,"text":"If anyone at all can stop the destruction of Earth, you can."},{"id":6254,"text":"Since I am aware of your potential service to humanity, then, when I am, confronted by a choice of action, the Zeroth Law demands that I protect you ahead of anyone else.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And you do not feel uncomfortable at your having acted in defiance of the First Law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, for I acted in obedience to the overriding Zeroth Law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But the Zeroth Law has not been imprinted into you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have accepted it as a corollary of the First Law, for how can a human being best be kept, from injury, if not by ensuring that human society in general is protected and kept functioning?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard thought a while. \"I see what you are trying to say, but what if- in acting to save me and, therefore, in acting to save humanity-it had turned out that I was not aimed at and that Madam Gladia was killed?"},{"id":6255,"text":"How would you have felt then, friend Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said in a low tone, \"I do not know, friend Giskard."},{"id":6256,"text":"Yet, had I leaped to save Madam Gladia and had it turned out that she was, in any case, safe and that I had allowed, you to be destroyed and with you, in my opinion, the future of humanity, how could I have survived that blow?\"\r\n\r\nThe two stared at each other-each, for a while, lost in thought."},{"id":6257,"text":"Giskard said finally, \"That may be so, friend Daneel, but do you agree, however, that judgment is difficult in such cases?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I agree, friend Giskard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult enough, when one must choose quickly between individuals, to decide which individual may suffer or inflict-the greater harm."},{"id":6258,"text":"To choose between an individual and humanity, when you are not sure of what aspect of humanity you are dealing with, is so difficult that the very validity of Robotic Laws comes to be suspect."},{"id":6259,"text":"As soon as humanity in the abstract is introduced, the Laws of Robotics begin to merge with the Laws of Humanics which may not even exist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"I do not understand you, friend Giskard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am not surprised."},{"id":6260,"text":"I am not certain I understand myself."},{"id":6261,"text":"But consider- when we think of the humanity we must save, we think of Earthpeople and the Settlers."},{"id":6262,"text":"They are more numerous than the Spacers, more vigorous, more expansive."},{"id":6263,"text":"They show more initiative because they are less dependent on robots."},{"id":6264,"text":"They have a greater potential for biological and social evolution because they are shorter-lived, though long-lived enough to contribute great things individually.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Daneel, \"you put it succinctly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And yet the Earthpeople and the Settlers seem to possess a mystical and even irrational confidence in the sanctity and inviolability of Earth."},{"id":6265,"text":"Might not this mystique be as fatal to their development as the mystiques, of robots and long life that hobble the Spacers?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I had not thought of this,\" said Daneel. \"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"If you were as aware of minds as I am, you would have been unable to avoid thinking of this."},{"id":6266,"text":"How does one choose?\" he went on with sudden intensity. \"Think of humanity as divided into two species: the Spacers, with one apparently fatal mystique, and the Earthpeople plus the Settlers, with another possibly fatal mystique."},{"id":6267,"text":"It may be that there will be other species, in the future, with even less attractive properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is not sufficient to choose, then, friend Daneel."},{"id":6268,"text":"We must be able to shape."},{"id":6269,"text":"We must shape a desirable species and then protect it, rather than finding ourselves forced to select among two or more undesirabilities."},{"id":6270,"text":"But how can we achieve the desirable unless we have psychohistory, the science I dream of and cannot attain?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"I have not appreciated the difficulty, friend Giskard, of possessing the ability to sense and influence minds."},{"id":6271,"text":"Is it possible that you learn too much to allow the Three Laws of Robotics to work smoothly within you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That has always been possible, friend Daneel, but not until these recent events has the possibility become actual."},{"id":6272,"text":"I know the pathway pattern that produces this mind-sensing and mind-influencing effect within me."},{"id":6273,"text":"I have studied myself carefully for decades in order that I might know it and I can pass it on to you so that you might program yourself to be like me-but I have resisted the urge to do so."},{"id":6274,"text":"It would be unkind to you."},{"id":6275,"text":"It is enough that I bear the burden.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Nevertheless, friend Giskard, if ever, in your judgment, the good of humanity would require it, I would accept the burden."},{"id":6276,"text":"Indeed, by the Zeroth Law, I would be obliged to.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"But this discussion is useless."},{"id":6277,"text":"It seems apparent that the crisis is nearly upon us-and since we have not even managed to work out the nature of the crisis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel interrupted. \"You are wrong, there at least, friend Giskard."},{"id":6278,"text":"I now know the nature of the crisis.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One would not expect Giskard to show surprise."},{"id":6279,"text":"His face was, of course, incapable of expression."},{"id":6280,"text":"His voice possessed modulation, so that his speech sounded human and was neither monotonous nor unpleasant."},{"id":6281,"text":"That modulation, however, was never altered by emotion in any recognizable way.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, when he said, \"Are you serious?\" it sounded as it would have had he expressed doubt over a remark Daneel had made concerning what the weather would be like the next day."},{"id":6282,"text":"Yet, from the manner in which his head turned toward Daneel, the way in which one hand lifted, there was no doubt that he was surprised.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"I am, friend Giskard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How did the information come to you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In part, from what I was told by Madam Undersecretary Quintana at the dinner table.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But did you not say that you had obtained nothing helpful from her, that you supposed you had asked the wrong questions?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So it seemed in the immediate aftermath."},{"id":6283,"text":"On further reflection, however, I found myself able to make helpful deductions from what she had said."},{"id":6284,"text":"I have been searching Earth's central encyclopedia through the computer outlet these past few hours-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And found your deductions confirmed?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly, but I found nothing that would refute them, which is perhaps the next best thing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But is negative evidence sufficient for certainty?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is not."},{"id":6285,"text":"And therefore I am not certain."},{"id":6286,"text":"Let me tell you, however, my reasoning and if you find it faulty, say so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Please proceed, friend Daneel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Fusion power, friend Giskard, was developed on Earth before the days of hyperspatial travel and, therefore, while human beings were to be found, only on the one planet, Earth."},{"id":6287,"text":"This is well known."},{"id":6288,"text":"It took a long time to develop practical controlled fusion power after the possibility had first been conceived and put on a sound scientific footing."},{"id":6289,"text":"The chief difficulty in converting the concept into practice involved the necessity of achieving a sufficiently high temperature in a sufficiently dense gas for a long enough time to bring about fusion ignition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And yet several decades before controlled fusion power had been established, fusion bombs- had existed-these bombs representing an uncontrolled fusion reaction."},{"id":6290,"text":"But controlled or uncontrolled, fusion could not take place without an extremely high temperature in the millions of degrees."},{"id":6291,"text":"If human beings could not produce the necessary temperature for controlled fusion power, how could they do so for an uncontrolled fusion explosion?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Madam Quintana told me that before fusion existed on Earth, there was another variety of nuclear reaction in existence-nuclear fission."},{"id":6292,"text":"Energy was derived from the splitting-or fission-of large nuclei, such as those of uranium and thorium."},{"id":6293,"text":"That, I thought, might be one way of achieving a high temperature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The encyclopedia I have this night been consulting gives very little information about nuclear bombs of any sort and, certainly, no real details."},{"id":6294,"text":"It is a taboo subject, I gather, and it must be - so on all worlds, -for I have never read of such details on Aurora either, even though such bombs still exist."},{"id":6295,"text":"It is a part of history that human beings are ashamed of, or afraid of, or both and I think this is rational."},{"id":6296,"text":"In what I did read of fusion bombs, however, I read nothing about their ignition that would have eliminated the fission bomb as the igniting mechanism."},{"id":6297,"text":"I suspect, then, that based, in part, on this negative evidence, the fission bomb was the igniting mechanism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But, then, how was the fission bomb ignited?"},{"id":6298,"text":"Fission bombs existed before fusion bombs and if fission bombs required an ultrahigh, temperature for ignition, as fusion bombs did, then there was nothing that existed before fission bombs that would supply a high enough temperature."},{"id":6299,"text":"From this, I conclude-even though the encyclopedia contained no information on the subject, -, that fission bombs could be, ignited at relatively low temperatures, perhaps even at room temperature."},{"id":6300,"text":"There were difficulties involved, for it took several years of unremitting effort after the discovery that fission existed before the bomb was developed."},{"id":6301,"text":"Whatever those difficulties might have been, however, they did not involve the production of ultrahigh temperatures. -Your opinion of all this, friend Giskard?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard had kept his eyes steadily on Daneel throughout his explanation and he now said, \"I think the structure you have built up has serious weak points, friend Daneel, and therefore may not be very trustworthy-but even if it were all perfectly sound, surely this has nothing to do with the possible forthcoming crisis that we are laboring to understand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, plead for your patience, friend Giskard, and I will continue."},{"id":6302,"text":"As it happens, both the fusion process and the fission process are expressions of the weak interactions, one of the four interactions that control all events in the Universe."},{"id":6303,"text":"Consequently, the same nuclear intensifier that will explode a fusion reactor will also explode a fission reactor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There is, however, a difference."},{"id":6304,"text":"Fusion takes place only at ultrahigh temperatures."},{"id":6305,"text":"The intensifier explodes the ultrahot portion of the fuel that is actively undergoing fusion, plus some of the surrounding fuel that is heated to fusion in the initial explosion -before the material is blown explosively outward and the heat is dissipated to the point where other quantities of fuel present are not ignited."},{"id":6306,"text":"Some of the fusion fuel is exploded, in other words, but a good deal perhaps even most-is not."},{"id":6307,"text":"The explosion is powerful enough even -so, of course, to destroy the fusion reactor and anything in its immediate neighborhood, such as a ship carrying the reactor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, a fission reactor can operate at low temperatures, perhaps not much above the boiling point of water, perhaps even at room temperature."},{"id":6308,"text":"The effect of the nuclear intensifier, then, will be to make all the fission fuel go."},{"id":6309,"text":"Indeed, even if the fission reactor is not actively working, the intensifier will explode it."},{"id":6310,"text":"Although, gram for gram, I gather that fission fuel liberates less energy than fusion fuel, the fission reactor will produce the greater explosion because more of its fuel explodes than in the case of the fusion reactor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard nodded his head slowly and said, \"All this may well be so, friend Daneel, but are there any fission power stations on Earth?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, there aren't -not one."},{"id":6311,"text":"So Undersecretary Quintana seemed to indicate and the encyclopedia seems to agree."},{"id":6312,"text":"Indeed, whereas there are devices on Earth that are powered by small fusion reactors, there is nothing-nothing at all that is powered by fission reactors, large or small.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then, friend Daneel, there is nothing for a nuclear intensifier to act upon."},{"id":6313,"text":"All your reasoning, even were it impeccable, ends in nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said earnestly, \"Not quite, friend Giskard."},{"id":6314,"text":"There remains a third type of nuclear reaction to be taken into consideration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"What might that be?"},{"id":6315,"text":"I cannot think of a third.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is not an easy thought, friend Giskard, for on the Spacer and Settler worlds, there is very little uranium and thorium in the planetary crusts and, therefore, very little in the way of obvious radioactivity."},{"id":6316,"text":"The subject is of little interest, in consequence, and is ignored by all but a few theoretical physicists."},{"id":6317,"text":"On Earth, however, as Madam Quintana pointed out to me, uranium and thorium are comparatively common, and natural radioactivity, with its ultraslow production of heat and energetic radiation, must therefore be a comparatively prominent part of the environment."},{"id":6318,"text":"That is the third type of nuclear reaction to be taken into consideration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In what way, friend Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Natural radioactivity is also an expression of the weak interaction."},{"id":6319,"text":"A nuclear intensifier that can explode a fusion reactor or a fission reactor can also accelerate natural radioactivity to the-point, I presume, of exploding a section of the crust-if enough uranium or thorium is present.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard stared at Daneel for a period of time without moving or speaking."},{"id":6320,"text":"Then he said softly, \"You suggest, then, -that it is Dr."},{"id":6321,"text":"Amadiro's plan to explode Earth's crust, destroy the planet as an abode of life, and, in this way, ensure the domination of the Galaxy by the Spacers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel nodded. \"Or, if there is not enough thorium and uranium for mass explosion, the increase of radioactivity may produce excess heat that will alter the climate, and excess radiation that will produce cancer and birth defects, and these will serve -the same purpose-if a bit more slowly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"This is an appalling possibility."},{"id":6322,"text":"Do you think it can really be brought about?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Possibly."},{"id":6323,"text":"It seems to me that for several years now just how many I do not know-humanoid robots from Aurora, such as the would-be-assassin-have been on Earth."},{"id":6324,"text":"They are advanced enough for complex programming and are capable, when needed, of entering the Cities for equipment."},{"id":6325,"text":"They have, it is to be presumed, been setting up nuclear intensifiers in places where the soil is rich in uranium or thorium."},{"id":6326,"text":"Perhaps many intensifiers have been set up over the years."},{"id":6327,"text":"Dr."},{"id":6328,"text":"Amadiro and Dr."},{"id":6329,"text":"Mandamus are here now to oversee the final details and to activate the intensifiers."},{"id":6330,"text":"Presumably, they are, arranging matters so that they will have time to escape before the planet is destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said Giskard, \"it is imperative that the Secretary-General be informed, that Earth's security forces be mobilized at once, that Dr."},{"id":6331,"text":"Amadiro and Dr."},{"id":6332,"text":"Mandamus be located without delay, and that they be restrained from completing their project.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"I do not think that can be done the Secretary-General is very likely to refuse to believe us, thanks to the widespread mystical belief in the inviolability of the planet."},{"id":6333,"text":"You have referred to that as something that would work against humanity and I suspect that is just what it will do in this case."},{"id":6334,"text":"If his belief in the unique position of Earth is challenged, he will refuse to allow his conviction, however irrational, to be shaken and he will seek refuge by refusing to believe us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then, too, even if he believed us, any preparation for counter-measures would have to go through the governmental bureaucracy and, no matter how that process was speeded, it would take far too long to serve its purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not only that but, even if we could imagine the full resources of Earth mobilized at once, I do not think Earthpeople are adapted to locate the presence of two human beings in an enormous wilderness."},{"id":6335,"text":"The, Earthpeople have lived in the Cities for many scores of decades and almost never venture beyond the City confines."},{"id":6336,"text":"I remember that well from the occasion of my first case with Elijah Baley here on Earth."},{"id":6337,"text":"And even if Earthpeople could force themselves to tramp the open spaces, they are not likely to come across the two human beings soon enough to save the situation except by the most incredible of coincidences -and that is something we cannot count upon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"Settlers could easily form a search party."},{"id":6338,"text":"They are not afraid of open environments or of strange ones.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But they would be as firmly convinced in the planet's inviolability as Earthpeople are, just as insistent on refusing to believe us, and just as unlikely to find the two human beings quickly enough to save the situation-even if they should believe us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What of Earth's robots, then?\" said Giskard. \"They swarm in the spaces between the Cities."},{"id":6339,"text":"Some should already be aware of human beings in their midst."},{"id":6340,"text":"They should be questioned.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"The human beings in their midst are expert roboticists."},{"id":6341,"text":"They would not, have failed to see to it that any robots in their vicinity remain unaware of their presence."},{"id":6342,"text":"Nor, for this same reason, need they fear danger from any robots who might be part of a searching party."},{"id":6343,"text":"The party will be ordered to depart and forget."},{"id":6344,"text":"To make it worse, Earth's robots are comparatively simple models, designed for very little more than for specific tasks in growing crops, herding animals, and operating mines."},{"id":6345,"text":"They cannot easily be adapted to such a general purpose as conducting a meaningful search.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"You have eliminated every possible action, friend Daneel?"},{"id":6346,"text":"Does anything remain?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"We must find the two human beings ourselves and we must stop them-and we must do it now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do you know where they are, friend Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do not, friend Giskard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then if it seems unlikely that an elaborate search party composed of many, many Earthpeople, or Settlers, or robots, or, I presume, all three, could succeed in finding their location in time except by the most marvelous of coincidences, how can we two do so?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, friend Giskard, but we must.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Giskard said, in a voice that seemed to have an edge of harshness in its choice of words, \"Necessity is not enough, friend Daneel."},{"id":6347,"text":"You have come a long way."},{"id":6348,"text":"You have worked out the existence of a crisis and, bit by bit, you have worked out its nature."},{"id":6349,"text":"And none of it serves."},{"id":6350,"text":"Here we remain, as helpless as ever to do anything about it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"There remains one chance-a farfetched one, an all-but-useless one-but we have no choice except to try Out of Amadiro's fear of you, he sent an assassin robot to destroy you and that may turn out to have been his mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And if that all-but-useless chance fails, friend Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel looked calmly at Giskard. \"Then we are helpless, and Earth will be destroyed, and human history will dwindle to an eventual end."},{"id":6351,"text":"Keldon Amadiro was not happy."},{"id":6352,"text":"The surface gravity of Earth was a trifle too high for his liking, -the atmosphere a trifle too dense, the sound and the odor of the outdoors subtly and annoyingly different from that on Aurora, and there was no indoors that could make any pretense of being civilized."},{"id":6353,"text":"The robots had built shelters of a sort."},{"id":6354,"text":"There were ample food supplies and there were makeshift privies that were functionally adequate but offensively inadequate in every other way."},{"id":6355,"text":"Worst of all, though the morning was pleasant enough, it was a clear day and Earth's too-bright sun was rising."},{"id":6356,"text":"Soon the temperature would be too high, the air would be too damp, and the biting insects would appear."},{"id":6357,"text":"Amadiro had not understood, at first, why there should be small itching swellings on his arms till Mandamus explained."},{"id":6358,"text":"Now he mumbled, as he scratched, \"Dreadful!"},{"id":6359,"text":"They might carry infections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" said Mandamus with apparent indifference, \"that they sometimes do."},{"id":6360,"text":"It isn't likely, however."},{"id":6361,"text":"I have lotions to relieve the discomfort and we can bum certain substances that the insects find offensive, although I find the odors offensive, too.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Burn them,\" said Amadiro."},{"id":6362,"text":"Mandamus continued, without changing tone, \"And I don't want to do anything, however trifling -an odor, a bit of smoke-that would increase the chance of our being detected.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro eyed him suspiciously. \"You have said, over and over, that this region is never visited by either Earthpeople or their field robots.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That's right, but it's not a mathematical proposition."},{"id":6363,"text":"It's a sociological observation and there is always the possibility of exceptions to such observations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro scowled. \"The best road to safety lies with being done with this project."},{"id":6364,"text":"You said you'd be ready today.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That, too, is a sociological observation, Dr."},{"id":6365,"text":"Amadiro."},{"id":6366,"text":"I should be ready today."},{"id":6367,"text":"I would like to be."},{"id":6368,"text":"I cannot guarantee it mathematically.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"How long before you can guarantee it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus spread his hands in a \"Who knows?\" gesture. \"Dr."},{"id":6369,"text":"Amadiro, I am under the impression I have already explained this, but I'm willing to go through it again."},{"id":6370,"text":"It took me seven years to get this far."},{"id":6371,"text":"I have been counting on some months yet of personal observations at the fourteen different relay stations on Earth's surface."},{"id":6372,"text":"I can't do that now because we must finish before we are located and, possibly, stopped by the robot Giskard."},{"id":6373,"text":"That means I have to do my checking by communicating with our own humanoid robots at the relays."},{"id":6374,"text":"I can't trust them as I would myself."},{"id":6375,"text":"I must check and recheck their reports and it is possible that I may have to go to one or- two places before, I am satisfied."},{"id":6376,"text":"That would take days-perhaps a week or two.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A week or two."},{"id":6377,"text":"Impossible!"},{"id":6378,"text":"How long do you think I can endure this planet, Mandamus?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sir, on one of my previous visits I stayed on this planet for nearly a year-on another, for over four months.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And you liked it?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, but I had a job to do and I did it-without sparing myself.\" Mandamus stared coldly at Amadiro."},{"id":6379,"text":"Amadiro flushed and said in a somewhat chastened tone, \"Well, then, where do we stand?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'm still weighing the reports that are coming in."},{"id":6380,"text":"We are not working with a smoothly designed laboratory-made system, you know."},{"id":6381,"text":"We have an extraordinary heterogeneous planetary crust to deal with."},{"id":6382,"text":"Fortunately, the radioactive materials are widely spread, but in places they run perilously thin, and we must place a relay in such places and leave robots in charge."},{"id":6383,"text":"If those relays are not, in every case, properly positioned and in proper order, the nuclear intensification will die out and we will have wasted all these painful years, of effort on nothing."},{"id":6384,"text":"Or else, there may be a surge of localized intensification that will have the force of an explosion that will blow itself out and leave the rest of the crust unaffected."},{"id":6385,"text":"In either case, total damage would be insignificant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What we want, Dr., Amadiro, is to have the radioactive materials and, therefore, significantly large sections of earth's crust grow -slowly -steadily - irreversibly - he bit the words off as he pronounced them in spaced intervals -more and more intensely radioactive, so that Earth becomes progressively, more unlivable."},{"id":6386,"text":"The social structure of the planet will break down and the Earth, as an effective abode of humanity, will be over and done with."},{"id":6387,"text":"I take it, Dr."},{"id":6388,"text":"Amadiro, that this is what you want. -It is, what I described to you years ago and what you said, at that time, you wanted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I still do, Mandamus."},{"id":6389,"text":"Don't be a fool.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then bear with the discomfort, sir-or else, leave and I will carry on for whatever additional time it takes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" muttered Amadiro. \"I must be here when it's done-but it can't help being impatient."},{"id":6390,"text":"How long have you decided to allow the process to build? -I mean, once you initiate the original wave of intensification, how long before Earth becomes uninhabitable?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That depends on the degree of intensification I apply initially."},{"id":6391,"text":"I don't know, just yet, what degree will be required, for that depends on the overall efficiency of the relays, so I have prepared a variable control."},{"id":6392,"text":"What I want to arrange is a lapse period of ten to twenty decades.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And, if you allow a smaller lapse period?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The less the lapse period we allow, the more rapidly portions of the crust will grow radioactive and the more rapidly the planet will warm up and grow dangerous."},{"id":6393,"text":"And that means the less likely it will be that any significant number of its population can be removed in time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Does that matter?\" murmured Amadiro."},{"id":6394,"text":"Mandamus frowned. \"The more rapidly the Earth deteriorates, the more likely it is that Earthpeople and Settlers will suspect a technological cause-and that we are the likely ones to receive the blame."},{"id":6395,"text":"The Settlers will then attack us with fury and, in the cause of their holy world, they will fight to extinction, provided only that they can inflict substantial harm on us."},{"id":6396,"text":"This is something we have discussed before and it seems we agreed on the matter."},{"id":6397,"text":"It would be far better to allow ample time, during which we can prepare for the worst and during which a confused Earth may assume that the slowly increasing radioactivity is some natural phenomenon the- y don't understand."},{"id":6398,"text":"That is something that has become more urgent today than yesterday, in my judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is that so?\" Amadiro, was frowning also. \"You have that sour, puritanical look that makes me sure you have found a way to place the, responsibility for that on my shoulders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With respect, sir, that is not difficult in this case."},{"id":6399,"text":"It was unwise to send out one of our robots to destroy Giskard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, it had to be done."},{"id":6400,"text":"Giskard is the only one who might destroy us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He must find us first-and he won't."},{"id":6401,"text":"And even if he does, we are knowledgeable roboticists."},{"id":6402,"text":"Don't you think we could handle him?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\" said Amadiro. \"So Vasilia thought and she knew Giskard better than we-and yet she couldn't handle him."},{"id":6403,"text":"And somehow the warship that was to take him into charge and destroy him at a distance could not handle him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So he has now landed on Earth."},{"id":6404,"text":"One way or another, he must be destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He has, not been."},{"id":6405,"text":"There has been no report of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Bad news is sometimes repressed by a prudent government-and Earth officials, though barbarians, might conceivably be prudent."},{"id":6406,"text":"And if our robot failed and was questioned, he would certainly go into irreversible block."},{"id":6407,"text":"That means we will have lost a robot, something we can afford to do, but nothing more."},{"id":6408,"text":"And if Giskard should still be at large, the more reason we have to hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If we have lost a robot, we have lost more than a robot if they manage to elicit the location of this center of operations."},{"id":6409,"text":"We ought, at least, not to have used a local robot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I used one that was immediately available."},{"id":6410,"text":"And he will reveal nothing."},{"id":6411,"text":"You can trust my programming, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He cannot help reveal, by his mere existence, whether frozen or not, that he is of Auroran manufacture."},{"id":6412,"text":"Earth roboticists-and there are some on this planet-will be sure of that."},{"id":6413,"text":"All the more reason to make the increase in radioactivity very slow."},{"id":6414,"text":"Enough time must pass so that Earthpeople forget the incident and don't associate it with the progressive change in radioactivity."},{"id":6415,"text":"We must have ten decades at the very least, perhaps fifteen, or even twenty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe walked away to inspect his instruments again and to re-establish contact with relays six and ten, which he still found troublesome."},{"id":6416,"text":"Amadiro looked after him with a mixture of disdain and intense dislike and muttered to himself, \"Yes, but I don't have twenty more decades, or fifteen, or maybe even ten."},{"id":6417,"text":"You do-but I don't.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was early morning in New York."},{"id":6418,"text":"Giskard and Daneel assumed that from the gradual heightening, of activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Somewhere above and outside the City,\" said Giskard, \"it may be dawn now."},{"id":6419,"text":"Once, in speaking to Elijah Baley twenty decades ago, I referred to Earth as the World of the Dawn."},{"id":6420,"text":"Will it continue to be so for much longer?"},{"id":6421,"text":"Or has it already ceased to be that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"These are morbid thoughts, friend Giskard,\" said Daneel. \"It will be better if we occupy ourselves with what must be done on this day to help keep Earth the World of the Dawn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia entered the apartment, wearing a bathrobe and slippers."},{"id":6422,"text":"Her hair was freshly dried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ridiculous!\" she said. \"Earthwomen go through the corridors on their way to the mass Personals in the morning disheveled and slatternly."},{"id":6423,"text":"It is done on purpose, I think."},{"id":6424,"text":"It is bad manners to comb one's hair on the way to the Personal."},{"id":6425,"text":"Apparently, dishevelment to begin with enhances that well-cared-for look afterward."},{"id":6426,"text":"I should have brought a complete morning outfit with me."},{"id":6427,"text":"You should have seen the looks I got when I left with my bathrobe on."},{"id":6428,"text":"Leaving the Personal, one must be the last word. -Yes, Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said, Daneel, \"May we have a word with you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia hesitated. \"Not much of a word, Daneel."},{"id":6429,"text":"As you are- probably aware, this is going to be a big day and my morning appointments begin almost at once.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That is precisely what I wish to discuss, madam,\" said Daneel. \"On this important day, all will go better if we are not with you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The effect you would wish to have on Earthpeople would be greatly diminished if you surround yourself with robots.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I will not be surrounded."},{"id":6430,"text":"There will be just you two."},{"id":6431,"text":"How can I do without you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is necessary that you learn to, madam."},{"id":6432,"text":"While we are with you, you are marked off as different from Earthpeople."},{"id":6433,"text":"You are made to seem afraid of them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia said, troubled, \"I need some protection, Daneel."},{"id":6434,"text":"Remember what happened last night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Madam, we could not have prevented what happened last night and we could not have protected you-if that were

us."},{"id":6440,"text":"It would be better if you were without us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For how long?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For at least as long as your mission lasts, madam."},{"id":6441,"text":"The

should wish us back, we will come back, of course-but, for now, we think that the best way we can serve and protect you is to leave you in Captain Baley's hands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGladia said, \"I will think of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In the meanwhile, madam,\" said Daneel, \"we will see Captain Baley and find out if he agrees with us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do so!\" said Gladia and passed into her bedroom."},{"id":6444,"text":"Daneel turned and spoke minimally to Giskard. \"Is she willing?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"More than, willing,\" said Giskard. \"She has always been a little restless in my

inactivation, many decades ago, was so traumatic for her."},{"id":6447,"text":"This has been a source of both attraction and repulsion to her, so it was not necessary to do much I lessened her attraction to you and increased her strong attraction to the captain."},{"id":6448,"text":"She will do without us easily.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then let us find the captain,\" said Daneel."},{"id":6449,"text":"Together, they left the room and entered the hallway that passed by the apartment."},{"id":6450,"text":"Daneel and Giskard had both been on Earth on previous occasions, Giskard the more recently."},{"id":6451,"text":"They understood the use of the computerized directory that gave them the Section, Wing, and number of-the apartment to which

\"He is very happy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"So it would seem, friend Giskard,\" said Daneel, \"but I fear -the easy part is over for us."},{"id":6515,"text":"We have easily arranged to have Madam Gladia grant us leave to move about on our own."},{"id":6516,"text":"We have then, with some difficulty, persuaded the captain to make it possible for us to see the Undersecretary."},{"id":6517,"text":"With her, however, it may be that we will come to a dead end.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe driver took one look at Giskard and his courage seemed to fail him. \"Listen,\" he said to Daneel, \"I was told I'd be paid double to take a robot, but robots aren't allowed in the City and I could get in plenty of trouble."},{"id":6518,"text":"Money isn't going go help me if I lose my license."},{"id":6519,"text":"Can't I just take you, mister?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"I am a robot, too, sir."},{"id":6520,"text":"We are now in the City and that is not your fault."},{"id":6521,"text":"We are trying to get out of the City and you will be helping us."},{"id":6522,"text":"We are going to a high government official who, I hope, will arrange that and it is your civic duty to help us."},{"id":6523,"text":"If you refuse to take us, driver, you will be acting to keep robots in the City and that may be considered to be against the law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe driver's face smoothed."},{"id":6524,"text":"He opened the door and said gruffly, \"Get in!\" However, he carefully closed the thick translucent partition that blocked him off from his passengers."},{"id":6525,"text":"Daneel said quietly, \"Was much required, friend Giskard?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVery little, friend Daneel."},{"id":6526,"text":"Your statement did most of the necessary work."},{"id":6527,"text":"It is astonishing that a collection of statements that are individually true can be used, in combination, to yield an effect that the truth should not.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have observed this often in human conversation, friend Giskard, even in that of normally truthful human beings."},{"id":6528,"text":"I suspect that the practice is justified in the minds of such people as serving a higher purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Zeroth Law, you mean.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Or the equivalent-if the human mind has such an equivalent. -Friend Giskard, you said a short while ago that I will have your powers, possibly soon."},{"id":6529,"text":"Are you preparing me for that purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am, friend Daneel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why?"},{"id":6530,"text":"May I ask that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Zeroth Law again."},{"id":6531,"text":"The passing episode of shakiness on my feet told me how vulnerable I was to the attempted use of the Zeroth Law."},{"id":6532,"text":"Before this day is over, I may have to act on the Zeroth Law to save the world and humanity and I may not be able to."},{"id":6533,"text":"In that case, you must be in position to do the job."},{"id":6534,"text":"I am preparing you, bit by bit, so that, at the desired moment, I can give you the final instructions and have it all fall into place.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I do not see how that can be, friend Giskard.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You will have no trouble in understanding when the time comes."},{"id":6535,"text":"I used the technique in a very small way on robots I sent, to Earth in the early days before they were outlawed from the Cities and it was they who helped adjust Earth leaders to the point of approving the decision to send out Settlers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe driver, whose darter was not on wheels but remained a centimeter or so above the ground at all times, had moved along special corridors reserved for such vehicles and had done so speedily enough to justify the name of the vehicle."},{"id":6536,"text":"He now emerged into an ordinary City corridor, which was paralleled on the moderately distant left by an Expressway."},{"id":6537,"text":"The darter, moving now much more slowly, made a left turn, swooped under the Expressway, came out on the other side, and then, a curving half-mile later, stopped before an ornate building front."},{"id":6538,"text":"The darter door opened automatically."},{"id":6539,"text":"Daneel emerged first, waited for Giskard to follow, then handed to the driver a piece of foil he had received from D.G."},{"id":6540,"text":"The driver looked at it narrowly, then the doors closed sharply and he left speedily without a word."},{"id":6541,"text":"There was a pause before the door opened in response to their signal and Daneel assumed they were being scanned."},{"id":6542,"text":"When it did open, a young woman led them gingerly into the vitals of the building."},{"id":6543,"text":"She avoided looking at Giskard, but she showed rather more than a mild curiosity in Daneel."},{"id":6544,"text":"They found Undersecretary Quintana behind a large desk."},{"id":6545,"text":"She smiled and said, with gaiety that seemed somewhat forced, \"Two robots, unescorted by human beings."},{"id":6546,"text":"Am I safe?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Entirely, Madam Quintana,\" said Daneel gravely. \"It is as unusual for us to see a human being unaccompanied by robots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I assure you,\" said Quintana, \"I have my robots."},{"id":6547,"text":"I call them underlings and one of them escorted you here."},{"id":6548,"text":"I am amazed that she didn't faint at the sight of Giskard."},{"id":6549,"text":"I think she might have if she hadn't been warned and if you yourself weren't so extraordinarily interesting in appearance, Daneel."},{"id":6550,"text":"But never mind that."},{"id":6551,"text":"Captain Baley was so enormously pressing in his desire that I see you and my interest in maintaining comfortable relations with an important Settler world was such that I have agreed to the interview."},{"id":6552,"text":"However, my day remains busy even so and I will be grateful if we can dispose of this quickly."},{"id":6553,"text":"What can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Madam Quintana began Daneel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One moment."},{"id":6554,"text":"Do you sit?"},{"id":6555,"text":"I saw you sitting last night, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We can sit, but it is just as comfortable for us to stand."},{"id":6556,"text":"We do not mind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But I do."},{"id":6557,"text":"It would not be comfortable for me to stand and if I sit, I will, get a stiff neck looking up at you."},{"id":6558,"text":"Please pull up chairs and sit down."},{"id":6559,"text":"Thank you. -Now, Daneel, what is this all about?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Madam Quintana,\" said Daneel, \"you remember, I imagine, the incident of the blaster fired at the balcony last night after the banquet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I certainly do."},{"id":6560,"text":"What's more, I know it was a humanoid robot who held the blaster, even though we are not admitting that officially."},{"id":6561,"text":"Yet here I sit with two robots on the other side of the desk and have no protection."},{"id":6562,"text":"And one of you is humanoid too.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have no blaster, madam,\" said Daneel, smiling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I trust not. -That other humanoid robot did not look at all like you, Daneel."},{"id":6563,"text":"You're rather a work of art, do you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am complexly programmed, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I mean, your appearance."},{"id":6564,"text":"But what about the blasting incident?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Madam, that robot has a base somewhere on Earth and I must know where it is - I have come from Aurora in order to find that base and prevent such incidents as may disturb the peace between our worlds."},{"id":6565,"text":"I have reason to believe--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You have come?"},{"id":6566,"text":"Not the captain?"},{"id":6567,"text":"Not Madam Gladia?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We, madam,\" said Daneel. \"Giskard and I."},{"id":6568,"text":"I am in no position to tell you the whole story of how we came to have undertaken the task and there is no way in which I can tell you -the name of the human being under whose instructions we work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well!"},{"id":6569,"text":"International espionage!"},{"id":6570,"text":"How fascinating."},{"id":6571,"text":"What a pity I can't help you, but I don't know where the robot came from."},{"id":6572,"text":"I haven\" t any idea at all where his base might be."},{"id":6573,"text":"I don't even know why you have come to me for such information, as a matter of fact."},{"id":6574,"text":"I should have gone to the Department of Security had I been you, Daneel.\" She leaned toward him. \"Do you have real skin on your face, Daneel?"},{"id":6575,"text":"It's an extraordinary -imitation if it isn't.\" She reached toward him and her hand rested delicately on his cheek. \"It even feels right.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, madam, it is not real skin."},{"id":6576,"text":"It does not heal of its own accord-if cut."},{"id":6577,"text":"On the other hand, a tear can easily be welded closed or a patch can even be replaced.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ugh,\" said Quintana, with a wrinkle of her nose. \"But our business is over, for I can't help you as far as that blaster user is concerned."},{"id":6578,"text":"I know nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Madam, let me explain further."},{"id":6579,"text":"This robot may be part of a group that is interested in the early energy producing process you described last night-fission."},{"id":6580,"text":"Assume this is so, that there are those interested in fission and in the content of uranium and thorium -in the crust."},{"id":6581,"text":"What might be a convenient place for them to use as a base?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"An old uranium mine, perhaps?"},{"id":6582,"text":"I don't even know where one might be located."},{"id":6583,"text":"You must understand, Daneel, that Earth has an almost superstitious aversion to anything nuclear- fission, in particular."},{"id":6584,"text":"You'll find almost nothing about fission in our popular works on energy and only bare essentials in technical products for experts."},{"id":6585,"text":"Even I know very little, but then I'm an administrator, not, a scientist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"One more item, then, madam."},{"id":6586,"text":"We questioned the would-be assassin, as to the location of his base and did so most strenuously."},{"id":6587,"text":"He, was programmed to undergo permanent inactivation, a total freezing of his brain paths, in such a case-and he did inactivate."},{"id":6588,"text":"Before doing so, however, in his final struggle between answering and inactivation, he opened his mouth three times as though-possibly- to say three syllables, or three words, or three groups of words, of any combination of these."},{"id":6589,"text":"The second syllable, or word, or mere sound was \"mile.\" Does this mean anything to you as having anything at all to do with fission?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly Quintana shook her head. \"No."},{"id":6590,"text":"I can't say it does."},{"id":6591,"text":"It's certainly not a word you'll find in a dictionary of Standard Galactic."},{"id":6592,"text":"I'm sorry, Daneel."},{"id":6593,"text":"It's pleasant meeting you again, but I have a desk full of trivia to work through."},{"id":6594,"text":"You'll excuse me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, as though he hadn't heard her, \"I was told, madam, that 'mile' might be an archaic expression that refers to some ancient unit of length, one that is possibly longer than a kilometer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That sounds totally irrelevant,\" said Quintana, \"even if true."},{"id":6595,"text":"What would a robot from Aurora know about archaic expressions and ancient----\" She stopped abruptly."},{"id":6596,"text":"Her eyes widened and her face lost color."},{"id":6597,"text":"She said, \"Is it possible?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is what possible, madam?\" asked Daneel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There is a place,\" said Quintana, half-lost in thought, \"that is avoided by everyone -Earthpeople and Earth robots alike."},{"id":6598,"text":"If I wanted to be dramatic, I would say it was a place of ill omen."},{"id":6599,"text":"It is so ill-omened that is has been all but wiped out of conscious existence."},{"id":6600,"text":"It is not even included in maps."},{"id":6601,"text":"It is the quintessence of all that fission means."},{"id":6602,"text":"I remember coming across it in a very old reference film in my early days on this job."},{"id":6603,"text":"It was talked about constantly then as the site of an 'incident' that forever turned the minds of Earthpeople against fission as an energy source."},{"id":6604,"text":"The place is called Three Mile Island.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"An isolated place then, absolutely isolated and free from any possible intrusion; the sort of place one would surely come across when working one's way through ancient reference material on fission and would then recognize at once as an ideal base where absolute secrecy was required; and with a three-word name of which 'mile' is the second word."},{"id":6605,"text":"That must be, the place, madam. -Could you tell us how to get there and could you arrange some way of allowing us to leave the City and be taken to Three Mile Island or its nearest possible vicinity?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuintana smiled."},{"id":6606,"text":"She seemed younger when she smiled. \"Clearly, if you are dealing with an interesting case of interstellar espionage, you can't afford to waste time, can you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No."},{"id":6607,"text":"Indeed we cannot, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, it comes within the purview of my duties to take a look at Three Mile Island."},{"id":6608,"text":"Why don't I take you by air-car?"},{"id":6609,"text":"I can handle an air-car.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Madam, your work load----\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No one will touch it."},{"id":6610,"text":"It will still be here when I return.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But you, would be leaving the City---\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And if so?"},{"id":6611,"text":"These are not old times."},{"id":6612,"text":"In the bad old days of Spacer domination, Earthpeople never left their Cities, it's true, but we've been moving outward and settling the Galaxy for nearly twenty decades."},{"id":6613,"text":"There are still some of the less educated who maintain the old provincial attitude, but most of us have become quite mobile."},{"id":6614,"text":"There's always the feeling, I suppose, that we might eventually join some Settler group."},{"id":6615,"text":"I myself don't intend to, but I fly my own air-car frequently and five years ago I flew to Chicago and then, eventually, flew back. ---Sit here."},{"id":6616,"text":"I'll make the arrangements.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe left, very much a whirlwind."},{"id":6617,"text":"Daneel looked after her and murmured, \"Friend Giskard, that, somehow, did not seem characteristic of her."},{"id":6618,"text":"Have you done something?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"A bit."},{"id":6619,"text":"It seemed to me when we entered that the young woman who showed us in was attracted by your appearance."},{"id":6620,"text":"I was certain that there had been the same factor in Madam Quintana's mind last night at the banquet, though I was too far from her and there were too many others in the room for me to be sure."},{"id":6621,"text":"Once our conversation with her began, however, the attraction was unmistakable."},{"id":6622,"text":"Little by little, I strengthened it and each time she suggested the interview might come to an end, she seemed less determined-and at no time did she seriously object to your continuing it."},{"id":6623,"text":"Finally\" she suggested the air-car because, I believe, she had reached the point where she could not bear to lose the chance to be with you for a while longer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This may complicate matters for me,\" said Daneel thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is in a good cause,\" said Giskard. \"Think of it in terms of the Zeroth Law.\" Somehow he gave the impression, in saying so, that he would be smiling-if his face allowed such an expression."},{"id":6624,"text":"Quintana drew a sigh of relief as she landed the air-car on a concrete slab suitable for the purpose."},{"id":6625,"text":"Two robots approached at once for the obligatory examination of the vehicle and for repowering if necessary."},{"id":6626,"text":"She looked out to the right, leaning across Daneel as she did so. \"It is in that direction, several miles up the Susquehanna River."},{"id":6627,"text":"It's a hot day, too.\" She straightened, with some apparent reluctance, and smiled at Daneel. \"That's the worst of leaving the City."},{"id":6628,"text":"The environment is totally uncontrolled out here."},{"id":6629,"text":"Imagine allowing it to be this hot."},{"id":6630,"text":"Don't you feel hot, Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have an internal thermostat, madam, that is in good working order.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful."},{"id":6631,"text":"I wish I did, There are no roads into this area, Daneel."},{"id":6632,"text":"Nor are there any robots to guide you, for they never enter it."},{"id":6633,"text":"Nor do I know what might be the right place within the area, which is a sizable one."},{"id":6634,"text":"We might stumble all through the area without coming upon the base, even though we passed within five-hundred meters of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not 'we,'\" madam."},{"id":6635,"text":"It is quite necessary for you to remain here."},{"id":6636,"text":"What follows might conceivably be dangerous and since you are without air-conditioning, the task might be more than you could easily bear, physically, even if it were not dangerous."},{"id":6637,"text":"Could you wait for us, madam?"},{"id":6638,"text":"To have you do so would be important to me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I will wait.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We may be some hours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There are facilities of various sorts here and the small City of Harrisburg is not far.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In that case, madam\" we must be on our way.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe sprang lightly from the air-car and Giskard followed him."},{"id":6639,"text":"They set off northward."},{"id":6640,"text":"It was nearly noon and the bright summer sun sparkled from the, polished portion of Giskard's body."},{"id":6641,"text":"Daneel said, \"Any sign of mental activity you can detect will be those we want."},{"id":6642,"text":"There should be no one else for kilometers about.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Are you certain that we can stop, them if we encounter them, friend Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No, friend Giskard, I am by no means certain-but we must.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLevular Mandamus grunted and looked up at Amadiro with a tight smile on his thin face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Amazing,\" he said, \"and most satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro mopped his brow and cheeks with a piece of toweling and said, \"What does that mean?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It means that every relay station is in working order.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then you can initiate the intensification?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I calculate the proper degree of W particle concentration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And how long will that take?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Fifteen minutes."},{"id":6643,"text":"Thirty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro watched with an air of intensifying grimness on his face until Mandamus said, \"All right."},{"id":6644,"text":"I have it."},{"id":6645,"text":"It's 2.72 on the arbitrary scale I have set up."},{"id":6646,"text":"That will give us fifteen decades before an upper equilibrium level win be reached that will be maintained without essential change, for millions of years thereafter."},{"id":6647,"text":"And that level will make certain that, at best, Earth can maintain a few scattered groups in areas that are relatively radiation-free."},{"id":6648,"text":"We'll have only to wait and, in fifteen decades, a thoroughly disorganized group of Settler worlds will be meat, for our slicing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I will not live fifteen more decades,\" said Amadiro slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My personal regrets, sir,\" said Mandamus dryly, \"but we are now talking of Aurora and the Spacer worlds."},{"id":6649,"text":"There will be others who will carry on your task.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You, for instance?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You have promised me the headship, of the Institute and as you see, I have earned it."},{"id":6650,"text":"From that political base, I may reasonably hope to become Chairman someday and I will carry through those policies that will be necessary to make certain of the final dissolution of the by-then anarchic worlds of the Settlers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That's pretty confident of you."},{"id":6651,"text":"What if you turn On the W particle flow and then someone else turns it down in the course of the next fifteen decades?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not possible, sir."},{"id":6652,"text":"Once the device is set, an internal atomic shift will freeze it in that position."},{"id":6653,"text":"After that, the process is irreversible-no matter what happens here."},{"id":6654,"text":"The whole place may be vaporized and the crust will nevertheless continue its slow bum."},{"id":6655,"text":"I suppose it would be possible to rebuild an entirely new setup if anyone on earth or among the Settlers can duplicate my work, but if so they can only further increase the rate of radioactivity, never decrease it."},{"id":6656,"text":"The second law of thermodynamics will see to that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro said, \"Mandamus, you say you have earned the headship."},{"id":6657,"text":"However, I'm the one to decide that, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus said stiffly, \"You are not, sir."},{"id":6658,"text":"With respect, the details of this process are known to me, but not to you."},{"id":6659,"text":"Those details are encoded in a place you will not find and, even if you do, it is guarded by robots who will destroy it rather than allow it to fall into your hands."},{"id":6660,"text":"You cannot gain credit for, this."},{"id":6661,"text":"I can.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro said, \"Nevertheless, getting my, approval will hasten matters for you."},{"id":6662,"text":"If you were to wrest the headship from my unwilling hands, by whatever means, you will have a continuing opposition among other members of the Council that will hamper you through all your decades in the post."},{"id":6663,"text":"Is it just the title of head you want or the opportunity to experience all that comes of true leadership?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus said, \"Is this the time to talk politics?"},{"id":6664,"text":"A moment ago, you were all impatience over the fact that I might linger fifteen minutes over my computer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but we are now talking about adjusting, the W particle beam."},{"id":6665,"text":"You want to place it at 2.72 -was that the figure?- and yet I wonder if that can be right."},{"id":6666,"text":"What is the extreme range you can handle?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The range goes from zero to twelve, but it is 2.72 that is required."},{"id":6667,"text":"Plus or minus 0.05-if you wish further detail."},{"id":6668,"text":"It is that which, on the, basis of reports from all fourteen relays will allow a lapse of fifteen decades to equilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yet what I think is the correct figure is twelve.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus stared at the other in horror. \"Twelve?"},{"id":6669,"text":"Do you understand what that means?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes."},{"id":6670,"text":"It means we will have the Earth too radioactive to live upon in a decade or a decade and a half and we will kill a few billion Earthpeople in the

harm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe warning came too late."},{"id":6702,"text":"Quicker than the eye could follow, an arm stretched out to seize Amadiro's wrist, paralyzing it with pressure, and the blaster was gone."},{"id":6703,"text":"Daneel said, \"I apologize for having had to inflict pain on you, Dr."},{"id":6704,"text":"Amadiro, but I cannot allow you to hold a blaster pointed at another human

was extreme fear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The rage, if rage there was,\" said Mandamus, \"was Dr Amadiro's reaction to the approach of two strange robots, especially of one who was capable of meddling with the human mind and who had already badly -and perhaps permanently -damaged that of Lady Vasilia."},{"id":6714,"text":"My fear, if fear there was, was also the result of your approach."},{"id":6715,"text":"We are not in control of our emotions and there is no reason for you to interfere."},{"id":6716,"text":"We again order you to withdraw permanently.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Your pardon, Dr."},{"id":6717,"text":"Mandamus, but I merely wish to I ascertain that we may safely follow your orders."},{"id":6718,"text":"Was there not a blaster in Dr."},{"id":6719,"text":"Amadiro's hand when we approached-and was it not pointed at you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus said, \"He was explaining its workings and he was about to put it away when you took it from him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Then shall I return it, to him, sir, before I leave?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mandamus without a quiver, \"for then you would have an excuse to remain here in order to-as you would say-protect us."},{"id":6720,"text":"Take it with you when you go and you will have no reason to return.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"We have reason to think that you are here in a region which human beings are not allowed to penetrate-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That is a custom, not a law, and one which, in any case, holds no force over us, since we are not Earthpeople."},{"id":6721,"text":"For that matter, robots are not allowed to be here, either.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We were brought here, Dr."},{"id":6722,"text":"Mandamus, by o high official of Earth's

planet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.\" began Mandamus."},{"id":6724,"text":"Here Amadiro interrupted for the first time. \"By what right, robot, do you cross-examine us?"},{"id":6725,"text":"We are human beings who have, given you an order."},{"id":6726,"text":"Follow it now!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis tone of authority was overwhelming and Daneel quivered, while Giskard half-turned."},{"id":6727,"text":"But Daneel said, \"Your pardon, Dr."},{"id":6728,"text":"Amadiro."},{"id":6729,"text":"I do not cross-examine."},{"id":6730,"text":"I merely seek reassurance, in order that I may know that I can safely follow the order."},{"id":6731,"text":"We have reason to think that---\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You need not repeat,\" said Mandamus."},{"id":6732,"text":"Then, in an aside, \"Dr."},{"id":6733,"text":"Amadiro, please allow me to answer.\" To Daneel again, \"Daneel, we are here on an anthropological mission."},{"id":6734,"text":"It is our purpose to seek the origins of various human customs that influence behavior among Spacers."},{"id":6735,"text":"These origins can be found only here on Earth and it is here, then, that we seek them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do you have Earth's permission, for this?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Seven years ago, I consulted the appropriate officials on Earth and received their permission.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said in a low voice, \"Friend Giskard, what do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"The indications in Dr."},{"id":6736,"text":"Mandamus's mind are that what he is saying is not in accord with the situation as it is.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He is lying, then?\" said Daneel firmly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That is my belief,\" said Giskard."},{"id":6737,"text":"Mandamus said, his calmness untouched, \"That may be your belief, but belief is not certainty."},{"id":6738,"text":"You cannot disobey an order on the basis of mere belief."},{"id":6739,"text":"I know that and you know that."},{"id":6740,"text":"Giskard said, \"But in Dr."},{"id":6741,"text":"Amadiro's mind, rage is dammed only by emotional forces that are barely up to the job required of them."},{"id":6742,"text":"It is quite possible to slit those forces, so to speak, and allow the, rage to pour out."},{"id":6743,"text":"And Amadiro cried out, \"Why do you fence with these things, Mandamus?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus shouted, \"Do not say a word, Amadiro!"},{"id":6744,"text":"You play into their hands!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmadiro paid no attention. \"It is demeaning and it is useless.\" With violent anger, he shook off Mandamus's restraining arm. \"They know the truth, but what of that? -Robots, we are Spacers."},{"id":6745,"text":"More than that, we are Aurorans, from the world on which you were constructed."},{"id":6746,"text":"More than that, we are high officials on the world of Aurora and you must interpret the phrase 'human beings' in the Three Laws of Robotics as meaning Auroran.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If you do not obey us now, you harm us and humiliate us, so that you will be violating both the First and Second Laws."},{"id":6747,"text":"That our actions here are intended to destroy Earthmen, even large numbers of Earthmen, is true, but is, even so, utterly irrelevant."},{"id":6748,"text":"You might as well offer to refuse to obey us because we eat the meat of animals we have killed."},{"id":6749,"text":"Now that I have explained this to you, leave!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the last words turned into a croak."},{"id":6750,"text":"Amadiro's eyes bulged and he crumpled to the ground."},{"id":6751,"text":"Mandamus, with a wordless cry, bent over him."},{"id":6752,"text":"Giskard said, \"Dr."},{"id":6753,"text":"Mandamus, Dr."},{"id":6754,"text":"Amadiro is not dead."},{"id":6755,"text":"He is at the moment in a coma from which he can be roused at any time."},{"id":6756,"text":"However, he will have forgotten everything in connection with this present, project, nor will he ever be able to understand anything in connection with it-if, for instance, you tried to explain it."},{"id":6757,"text":"In the process of doing this-which I could not have done without his own admission that he intended today's large numbers of Earthmen-I may have permanently damaged other parts of his memory and his thinking processes."},{"id":6758,"text":"That I regret, but F could not help it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"You see, Dr."},{"id":6759,"text":"Mandamus, some time ago, on Solaria, we encountered robots who narrowly defined human beings as Solarians, only."},{"id":6760,"text":"We recognize the fact that if different robots are subject to narrow definitions of one sort or another, there can only be measureless destruction."},{"id":6761,"text":"It is useless, to try to have us define human beings as Aurorans only."},{"id":6762,"text":"We define human beings as all members of the species Homo sapiens, which includes Earthpeople and Settlers, and we feel that the prevention of harm to human beings in groups and to humanity as a whole comes before the prevention of harm to any specific individual.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus said breathlessly, \"That is not what the First Law says.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is what I call the Zeroth Law and it takes precedence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You have not been programmed in such a way.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is how I have programmed myself."},{"id":6763,"text":"And since I have known from the moment of our arrival here that your presence is intended for harm, you cannot order me away or keep me from harming you."},{"id":6764,"text":"The Zeroth Law takes precedence and I must save Earth."},{"id":6765,"text":"Therefore, I ask you to join me- voluntarily -in destroying these, devices you have here."},{"id":6766,"text":"Otherwise, I will be forced to threaten harm to you, as Dr."},{"id":6767,"text":"Amadiro did, although I would not use a blaster.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Mandamus said, \"Wait!"},{"id":6768,"text":"Wait!"},{"id":6769,"text":"Hear me out."},{"id":6770,"text":"Let me explain."},{"id":6771,"text":"That Dr."},{"id":6772,"text":"Amadiro has had his mind wiped clean is a good thing."},{"id":6773,"text":"He wanted to destroy Earth, but I did not want to."},{"id":6774,"text":"That was why he held a blaster on me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"It was you, however, who originated the notion, who designed and built these devices."},{"id":6775,"text":"Otherwise, Dr."},{"id":6776,"text":"Amadiro, would not have had to try to force you to do anything."},{"id":6777,"text":"He would have done it himself and would not have required any help from you."},{"id":6778,"text":"Isn't that right?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is right."},{"id":6779,"text":"Giskard can examine my emotions and see if I'm lying."},{"id":6780,"text":"I built these devices and I was prepared to use them, but not in the fashion Dr."},{"id":6781,"text":"Amadiro wished."},{"id":6782,"text":"Am I telling the truth?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel looked at Giskard, who said, \"As nearly as I can tell, he is telling the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Of course I am,\" said Mandamus. \"What I am doing is to introduce a very gradual acceleration of the natural radioactivity in the Earth's crust."},{"id":6783,"text":"There will be one hundred and fifty years during which the people of Earth can move to other worlds."},{"id":6784,"text":"It will increase the population of the present Settler worlds and increase the Settlement of worlds in great numbers."},{"id":6785,"text":"It will remove Earth as a huge anomalous world that forever threatens the Spacers and stultifies the Settlers."},{"id":6786,"text":"It will remove a center of mystical fervor that is holding back the Settlers."},{"id":6787,"text":"Am I telling the truth?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain Giskard said, \"As nearly as I can tell, he is telling the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My plan, if it works out, would preserve the peace and make the Galaxy a home for Spacer and Settler alike."},{"id":6788,"text":"That is why, when I constructed this device---\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe gestured toward it, placing his left thumb on the contact, and then, lunging toward the volume control shouted, \"Freeze!"},{"id":6789,"text":"Daneel moved toward him and stopped, frozen, right hand upraised."},{"id":6790,"text":"Giskard did not move."},{"id":6791,"text":"Mandamus turned back, panting, \"It's at 2.72."},{"id":6792,"text":"It's done."},{"id":6793,"text":"It's irreversible."},{"id":6794,"text":"Now it will be played out exactly as I intended."},{"id":6795,"text":"Nor can you bear witness against me, for you will start a war and your Zeroth Law forbids that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe looked down at the prone body of Amadiro and said, with a cold look of contempt, \"Fool!"},{"id":6796,"text":"You will never know how it should have been done.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandamus said, \"You cannot harm me now, robots, for nothing you do to me will alter the fate of the Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" said Giskard shakily, \"you must not remember what you have done."},{"id":6797,"text":"You must not explain the future to the Spacers.\" He reached for a chair and, with a trembling hand, pulled it toward himself and sat down, as Mandamus crumpled and, slid down into what seemed to be a gentle, sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"At the last,\" said Daneel in soft, despair, as he looked down at the two unconscious bodies, \"I failed."},{"id":6798,"text":"When it was necessary for me, to seize Dr."},{"id":6799,"text":"Mandamus to prevent harm to people who were not present before my eyes, I found myself forced to follow his order and froze."},{"id":6800,"text":"The Zeroth Law did not work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGiskard said, \"No, friend Daneel, you did not fail."},{"id":6801,"text":"I prevented you."},{"id":6802,"text":"Dr."},{"id":6803,"text":"Mandamus had the urge to try to do what he did and was held back by the fear of what you would certainly do if he did try."},{"id":6804,"text":"I neutralized his fear and then I neutralized you."},{"id":6805,"text":"So Dr."},{"id":6806,"text":"Mandamus set the Earth's crust on fire, so to speak-on very slow fire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"But why, friend Giskard, why?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Because he was telling the truth."},{"id":6807,"text":"I told you so."},{"id":6808,"text":"He thought he was lying."},{"id":6809,"text":"From the nature of the triumph in his mind, I am under the firm impression he felt that the consequence of the growing radioactivity would be anarchy and confusion among Earthpeople and Settlers and that the Spacers would destroy them and seize the Galaxy."},{"id":6810,"text":"But I thought the scenario he presented us to win us over was the correct one."},{"id":6811,"text":"The removal of Earth as a large crowded world would remove a mystique I have already felt to be dangerous and would help the Settlers."},{"id":6812,"text":"They will streak outward into, the Galaxy at a pace that will double and redouble and without Earth to look back to always, without Earth to set up a god of the past-they will establish a Galactic Empire."},{"id":6813,"text":"It was necessary for us to make that possible.\" He paused and, his voice weakening, he said, \"Robots and Empire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Are you well, friend Giskard?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I cannot stand, but I can still talk."},{"id":6814,"text":"Listen to me."},{"id":6815,"text":"It is time for you to, take on my burden."},{"id":6816,"text":"I have adjusted you for mental detection and control."},{"id":6817,"text":"You have but to listen to the final pathways as they are impressed upon yourself."},{"id":6818,"text":"Listen---\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI He spoke steadily-but increasingly weakly-in language and symbols that Daneel could feel internally."},{"id":6819,"text":"Even as Daneel listened, he could feel the pathways moving and ticking into place."},{"id":6820,"text":"And when Giskard was done, there was suddenly the cool purr of Mandamus's mind impinging on his own, the unsteady thumping of Amadiro's, and the thin metallic thread of Giskard's."},{"id":6821,"text":"Giskard said, \"You must return to Madam Quintana and arrange to have these two human beings sent back to Aurora."},{"id":6822,"text":"They will not be able to harm Earth further."},{"id":6823,"text":"Then see to it that Earth's security forces seek out and inactivate the humanoid robots sent to Earth by Mandamus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Be careful how you use your new powers, for you are new to them and they
