momentary sensation of being turned inside out."},{"id":264,"text":"It lasted an instant and Baley knew it was a Jump, that oddly incomprehensible, almost mystical, momentary transition through hyperspace that transferred a ship and all it contained from one point in space to another, lightyears away."},{"id":265,"text":"Another lapse of time and another Jump, still another lapse, still another Jump."},{"id":266,"text":"Baley told himself now that he was light-years away, tens of lightyears, hundreds, thousands."},{"id":267,"text":"He didn't know how many."},{"id":268,"text":"No one

he would not display weakness before the Spacers- he'd be damned if he would-he stiffened his body against the webbing that held him safe against the forces of deceleration, closed his eyes, and stubbornly fought panic."},{"id":295,"text":"Baley was losing his fight."},{"id":296,"text":"Reason alone was not enough."},{"id":297,"text":"Baley told himself over and over: Men live in the open all their lives."},{"id":298,"text":"The Spacers do so now."},{"id":299,"text":"Our ancestors on Earth did it in the past."},{"id":300,"text":"There is no real harm in

cried out for walls and would have none of space."},{"id":304,"text":"As time passed, he thought he would not succeed."},{"id":305,"text":"He would be cowering at the end, trembling and pitiful."},{"id":306,"text":"The Spacer they would send for him (with filters in his nose to keep out germs, and gloves on his hands to prevent contact) would not even honestly despise him."},{"id":307,"text":"The Spacer would feel only disgust."},{"id":308,"text":"Baley held on grimly."},{"id":309,"text":"When the ship stopped and the deceleration harness automatically uncoupled, while the hydraulic system retracted into the wall, Baley remained in his seat."},{"id":310,"text":"He was afraid, and determined not to show it."},{"id":311,"text":"He looked away at the first quiet sound of the door of his room opening."},{"id":312,"text":"There was the eye-corner flash of a tall, bronze-haired figure entering; a Spacer, one of those proud descendants of Earth who had disowned their heritage."},{"id":313,"text":"The Spacer spoke. \"Partner Elijah!\"\r\n\r\nBaley's head turned toward the speaker with a jerk."},{"id":314,"text":"His eyes rounded and he rose almost without

blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\"D-daneel.\"\r\n\r\nThe Spacer said, \"It is pleasant that you remember me, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember you!\" Baley felt relief wash over him."},{"id":316,"text":"This being was a bit of Earth, a friend, a comfort, a savior."},{"id":317,"text":"He had an almost unbearable desire to rush to the Spacer and embrace him, to hug him wildly, and laugh and pound his back and do all the foolish things old friends did when meeting once again after a separation."},{"id":318,"text":"But he didn't."},{"id":319,"text":"He couldn't."},{"id":320,"text":"He could only step forward, and hold out his hand and say, \"I'm not likely to forget you, Daneel.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is pleasant,\" said Daneel, nodding gravely. \"As you are well aware, it is quite impossible for me, while in working order, to forget you."},{"id":321,"text":"It is well that I see you again.\"\r\n\r\nDaneel took Baley's hand and pressed it with firm coolness, his fingers closing to a comfortable but not painful pressure and then releasing it."},{"id":322,"text":"Baley hoped earnestly that the creature's unreadable eyes could not penetrate Baley's mind and see that wild moment, just past and not yet entirely subsided, when all of Baley had concentrated into a feeling of an intense friendship that was almost love."},{"id":323,"text":"After all, one could not love as a friend this Daneel Olivaw, who was not a man at all, but only a robot."},{"id":324,"text":"The robot that looked so like a man said, \"I have asked that a robot-driven ground-transport vessel be connected to this ship by airBaley frowned. \"An air-tube?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes."},{"id":325,"text":"It is a common technique, frequently used in space, in order that personnel and materiel be transferred from one vessel to another without the necessity of special equipment against vacuum."},{"id":326,"text":"It would seem then that you are not acquainted with the technique.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Baley, \"but I get the picture.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, of course, rather complicated to arrange such a device between spaceship and ground vehicle, but I have requested that it be done."},{"id":327,"text":"Fortunately, the mission on which you and I are engaged is one of high priority."},{"id":328,"text":"Difficulties are smoothed out quickly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you assigned to the murder case too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you not been informed of that?"},{"id":329,"text":"I regret not having told\r\n\r\nyou at once.\" There was, of course, no sign of regret on the robot's perfect face. \"It was Dr."},{"id":330,"text":"Han Fastolfe, whom you met on Earth during our previous partnership .and whom I hope you remember, who first suggested you as an appropriate investigator in this case."},{"id":331,"text":"He made it a condition that I be assigned to work with you once more.\"\r\n\r\nBaley managed a smile."},{"id":332,"text":"Dr."},{"id":333,"text":"Fastolfe was a native of Aurora and Aurora was the strongest of the Outer Worlds."},{"id":334,"text":"Apparently the advice of an Auroran bore weight."},{"id":335,"text":"Baley said, \"A team that works shouldn't be broken up, eh?\" (The first exhilaration of Daneel's appearance was fading and the compression about Baley's chest was returning.)\r\n\r\n\"I do not know if that precise thought was in his mind, Partner Elijah."},{"id":336,"text":"From the nature of his orders to me, I should think that he was interested in having assigned to work with you one who would have experience w~th your worid and would know of your consequent peculiarities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pe~u1iarities!\" Ba1ey frowned and felt offended."},{"id":337,"text":"It was not a term he liked in connection with himse'f.\r\n\r\n\"So that I could arrange the air-tube,

the feeling that he had to counterattack or lose caste to a machine, that drove Baley to change the subject sharply."},{"id":339,"text":"Perhaps it was just that lifelong training prevented him from leaving any logical contradiction undisturbed."},{"id":340,"text":"He said, \"There was a robot in charge of my welfare on hoard ths ship; a robot\" (a touch of malice intruded itself here) \"that looks like a robot."},{"id":341,"text":"Do you know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I ~poke to it before coming on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's its designation?"},{"id":342,"text":"How do I make contact with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is RX-2475."},{"id":343,"text":"It is customary on Solaria to use only serial numbers for robots.\" Daneel's calm eyes swept the control panel near the door. \"This contact will signal it.\"\r\n\r\nBa'ey looked at the control panel himself and, since the contact to which Daneel pointed was labeled RX, its identification seemed quite unmysterious."},{"id":344,"text":"Baley put his finger over it and in less than a minute, the robot, the one that looked like a robot, entered."},{"id":345,"text":"Baley said, \"You are RX-2475.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You told me

mistake."},{"id":359,"text":"I thought also that perhaps a man had indeed been assigned to meet me and had later been replaced by you, RX-z475 not being informed of the change."},{"id":360,"text":"But you heard me check that."},{"id":361,"text":"Your papers were described to it and it was given your name."},{"id":362,"text":"But it was not quite given your name at that, was it,

full, Robot Daneel Olivaw.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quite correct, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n'Prom which it all follows that RX-2475 was never informed that you are a robot."},{"id":365,"text":"It was allowed to think of you as a man."},{"id":366,"text":"With your manlike appearance, such a masquerade is possible.~\r\n\r\n\"I have no quarrel with your reasoning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let's proceed.\" Baley was feeling the germs of a kind of savage delight."},{"id":367,"text":"He was on the trace of something."},{"id":368,"text":"It couldn't be anything much, but this was the kind of tracking he could do well."},{"id":369,"text":"It was something he could do well enough to be called half across space to do."},{"id":370,"text":"He said, \"Now why should anyone want to deceive a miserable robot?"},{"id":371,"text":"It doesn't matter to it whether you are man or robot."},{"id":372,"text":"It follows orders in either case."},{"id":373,"text":"A reasonable conclusion then is that the Solarian captain who informed the robot and the Solarian officials who informed the Captain did not themselves know you were a robot."},{"id":374,"text":"As I say, that is one reasonable conclusion, but perhaps not the only one."},{"id":375,"text":"Is this one true?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, then."},{"id":376,"text":"Good guess."},{"id":377,"text":"Now why?"},{"id":378,"text":"Dr."},{"id":379,"text":"Han Fastolfe, in recommending you as my partner allows the Solarians to think you are a human."},{"id":380,"text":"Isn't that a dangerous thing?"},{"id":381,"text":"The Solarians, if they find out, may be quite angry."},{"id":382,"text":"Why was it done?\"\r\n\r\nThe humanoid robot said, \"It was explained to me thus, Partner Elijah."},{"id":383,"text":"Your association with a human of the Outer Worlds would raise your status in the eyes of the Solarians."},{"id":384,"text":"Your association with a robot would lower it."},{"id":385,"text":"Since I was familiar with your ways and could work with you easily, it was thought reasonable to allow the Solarians to accept me as a man without actually deceiving them by a positive statement to that effect.\"\r\n\r\nBaley did not believe it."},{"id":386,"text":"It seemed like the kind of careful consideration for an Earthman's feelings that did not come naturally to a Spacer, not even to as enlightened a one as Fastolfe."},{"id":387,"text":"He considered an alternative and said, \"Are the Solarians well known among the Outer Worlds for the production of robots?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad,\" said Daneel, \"that you have been briefed concerning the inner economy of Solaria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a word,\" said Baley. \"I can guess the spelling of the word Solaria and there my knowledge stops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I do not see, Partner Elijah, what it was that impelled you to ask that question, but it is a most pertinent one."},{"id":388,"text":"You have hit the mark."},{"id":389,"text":"My mind-store of information includes the fact that, of\r\n\r\nthe fifty Outer Worlds, Solaria is by far the best known for the variety and excellence of robot models it turns out."},{"id":390,"text":"It exports specialized models to all the other Outer Worlds.\"\r\n\r\nBaley nodded in grim satisfaction."},{"id":391,"text":"Naturally Daneel did not follow an intuitive mental leap that used human weakness as a starting point."},{"id":392,"text":"Nor did Baley feel impelled to explain the reasoning."},{"id":393,"text":"If Solaria turned out to be a world expert in robotics, Dr."},{"id":394,"text":"Han Fastolfe and his associates might have purely personal and very human motives for demonstrating their own prize robot."},{"id":395,"text":"It would have nothing at all to do with an Earthman's safety or feelings."},{"id":396,"text":"They would be asserting their own superiority by allowing the expert Solarians to be fooled into accepting a robot of Auroran handiwork as a fellow-man."},{"id":397,"text":"Baley felt much better."},{"id":398,"text":"Strange that all the thought, all the intellectual powers he could muster, could not succeed in lifting him out of panic; and yet a sop to his own vainglory succeeded at once."},{"id":399,"text":"The recognition of the vainglory of the Spacers helped too."},{"id":400,"text":"He thought: Jehoshaphat, we're all human; even the Spacers."},{"id":401,"text":"Aloud he said, almost flippantly, \"How long do we have to wait for the ground-car?"},{"id":402,"text":"I'm ready.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe air-tube gave signs of not being well adapted to its present use."},{"id":403,"text":"Man and humanoid stepped out of the spaceship erect, moving along flexible mesh that bent and swayed under their weight. (In space, Baley imagined hazily, men transferring weightlessly from ship to ship might easily skim along the length of the tube, impelled by an initial Jump.)\r\n\r\nToward the other end the tube narrowed clumsily, its meshing bunching as though some giant hand had constricted it."},{"id":404,"text":"Daneel, carrying the flashlight, got down on all fours and so did Baley."},{"id":405,"text":"They traveled the last twenty feet in that fashion, moving at last into what was obviously a ground-car."},{"id":406,"text":"Daneel closed the door through which they had entered, sliding it shut carefully."},{"id":407,"text":"There was a heavy, clicking noise that might have been the detachment of the air-tube."},{"id":408,"text":"Baley looked about curiously."},{"id":409,"text":"There was nothing too exotic about the ground-car."},{"id":410,"text":"There were two seats in tandem, each of which could hold three."},{"id":411,"text":"There were doors at each end of each seat."},{"id":412,"text":"The glossy sections that might ordinarily have been windows were black\r\n\r\nand opaque, as a result, undoubtedly, of appropriate polarization."},{"id":413,"text":"Baley was acquainted with that."},{"id":414,"text":"The interior of the car was lit by two round spots of yellow illumination in the ceiling and, in short, the only thing Baley felt to be strange was the transmitter set into the partition immediately before the front seat and, of course, the added fact that there were no visible controls."},{"id":415,"text":"Baley said, \"I suppose the driver is on the other side of this partition.\"\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"Exactly so, Partner Elijah."},{"id":416,"text":"And we can give our orders in this fashion.\" He leaned forward slightly and flicked a toggle switch that set a spot of red light to flickering."},{"id":417,"text":"He said quietly, \"You may start now."},{"id":418,"text":"We are ready.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a muted whir that faded almost at once, a very slight, very transitory pressing against the back of the seat, and then nothing."},{"id":419,"text":"Baley said in surprise, \"Are we moving?\"\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"We are."},{"id":420,"text":"The car does not move on wheels but glides along a diamagnetic force-field."},{"id":421,"text":"Except for acceleration and deceleration, you will feel nothing.\"\r\n\r\n'\"What about curves?\"\r\n\r\n\"The car will bank automatically to compensate."},{"id":422,"text":"Its level is maintained when traveling up- or downhill.\"\r\n\r\n\"The controls must be complicated,\" said Baley dryly.\r\n\r\n\"Quite automatic."},{"id":423,"text":"The driver of the vehicle is a robot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Umm.\" Baley had about all he wanted on the ground-car."},{"id":424,"text":"He said, \"How long will this take?\"\r\n\r\n\"About an hour."},{"id":425,"text":"Air travel would have been speedier, but I was concerned to keep you enclosed and the aircraft models available on Solaria do not lend themselves to complete enclosure as does a ground-car such as that in which we are now riding.\"\r\n\r\nBaley felt annoyed at the other's \"concern.\" He felt like a baby in the charge of its nurse."},{"id":426,"text":"He felt almost as annoyed, oddly enough, at Daneel's sentences."},{"id":427,"text":"It seemed to him that such needlessly formal sentence structure might easily betray the robotic nature of the creature."},{"id":428,"text":"For a moment Baley stared curiously at R."},{"id":429,"text":"Daneel Olivaw."},{"id":430,"text":"The robot, looking straight ahead, was motionless and unseif-conscious under the other's gaze."},{"id":431,"text":"Daneel's skin texture was perfect, the individual hairs on head and body had been lovingly and intricately manufactured and placed."},{"id":432,"text":"The muscle movement under the skin was most realistic."},{"id":433,"text":"No pains, however extravagant, had been spared."},{"id":434,"text":"Yet Baley knew, from personal knowledge, that limbs and chest could be split open along invisible seams so that repairs might be made."},{"id":435,"text":"He knew there was metal and silicone under that realistic skin."},{"id":436,"text":"He knew a positronic brain, most advanced but only positronic, nestled in the hollow of the skull."},{"id":437,"text":"He knew that Daneel's \"thoughts\" were only short-lived positronic currents flowing along paths rigidly designed and foreordained by the manufacturer."},{"id":438,"text":"But what were the signs that would give that away to the expert eye that had no foreknowledge?"},{"id":439,"text":"The trifling unnaturalness of Daneel's manner of speech?"},{"id":440,"text":"The unemotional gravity that rested so steadily upon him?"},{"id":441,"text":"The very perfection of his humanity?"},{"id":442,"text":"But he was wasting time."},{"id":443,"text":"Baley said, \"Let's get on with it, Daneel."},{"id":444,"text":"I suppose that before arriving here,

percentage of fertile land is higher; its useful mineral content lower, but of course less exploited."},{"id":449,"text":"The world is self-supporting and can, with the aid of its robot exports,

\"You mean twenty million, don't you?\" His scant knowledge of the Outer Worlds was enough to tell him that, although the worlds were underpopulated by Earthly standards, the individual populations were in the millions.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty thousand people, Partner Elijah,\" said the robot again.\r\n\r\n\"You mean the planet has just been settled?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all."},{"id":450,"text":"It has been independent for nearly two centuries, and it was settled for a century or more before that."},{"id":451,"text":"The population is deliberately maintained at twenty thousand, that being considered

trifle dizzy."},{"id":456,"text":"Two hundred million robots!"},{"id":457,"text":"So many among so few humans."},{"id":458,"text":"The robots must litter the landscape."},{"id":459,"text":"An observer from without might think Solaria a world of robots altogether and fail to notice the thin human leaven."},{"id":460,"text":"He felt a sudden need to see."},{"id":461,"text":"He remembered the conversation with Minnim and the sociologic prediction of Earth's danger."},{"id":462,"text":"It seemed far off, a bit unreal, but he remembered."},{"id":463,"text":"His personal dangers and difficulties since leaving Earth dimmed the memory of Mmnim's voice stating enormities with cool and precise enunciation, but never blotted it out altogether."},{"id":464,"text":"Baley had lived too long with duty to allow even the overwhelming fact of open space to stop him in its performance."},{"id":465,"text":"Data collected from a Spacer's words, or from those of a Spacer robot for that

it."},{"id":467,"text":"He inspected the upper portion of the ground-car. \"Is this thing a convertible, Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, Partner Elijah, but I do not follow your meaning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can the car's top be pushed back?"},{"id":468,"text":"Can it be made open to the- the sky?\" (He had almost said \"dome\" out of habit.)\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then have that done, Daneel."},{"id":469,"text":"I would like to take a look.\"\r\n\r\nThe robot responded gravely, \"I am sorry, but I cannot allow that.\"\r\n\r\nBaley felt astonished.."},{"id":470,"text":"He said, \"Look, R."},{"id":471,"text":"Daneel\" (he stressed the R.). \"Let's rephrase that."},{"id":472,"text":"I order you to lower the top.\"\r\n\r\nThe creature was a robot, manlike or not."},{"id":473,"text":"It had to follow orders."},{"id":474,"text":"But Daneel did not move."},{"id":475,"text":"He said, \"I must explain that it is my first concern to spare you harm."},{"id":476,"text":"It has been clear to me on the basis both of my instructions and of my own personal experience that you would suffer harm at finding yourself in large, empty spaces."},{"id":477,"text":"I cannot, therefore, allow you to expose yourself to that.\"\r\n\r\nBaley could feel his face darkening with an influx of blood and at the same time could feel the complete uselessness of anger."},{"id":478,"text":"The creature was a robot, and Baley knew the First Law of Robotics well."},{"id":479,"text":"It went: A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm."},{"id":480,"text":"Everything else in a robot's positronic brain-that of any robot on any world in the Galaxy-had to bow to that prime consideration."},{"id":481,"text":"Of course a robot had to follow orders, but with one major, allimportant qualification."},{"id":482,"text":"Following orders was only the Second Law of Robotics."},{"id":483,"text":"It went: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law."},{"id":484,"text":"Baley forced himself to speak quietly and reasonably. \"I think I can endure it for a short time, Daneel.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not my feeling, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me be the judge, Daneel.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that is an order, Partner Elijah, I cannot follow it.\"\r\n\r\nBaley let himself lounge back against the softly upholstered seat."},{"id":485,"text":"The robot would, of course, be quite beyond the reach of force."},{"id":486,"text":"Daneel's strength, if exerted fully, would be a hundred times that\r\n\r\nof flesh and blood."},{"id":487,"text":"He would be perfectly capable of restraining\r\n\r\nBaley without ever hurting him."},{"id":488,"text":"Baley was armed."},{"id":489,"text":"He could point a blaster at Daneel, but, except for perhaps a momentary sensation of mastery, that action would only succeed in greater frustration."},{"id":490,"text":"A threat of destruction was useless against a robot."},{"id":491,"text":"Self-preservation was only the Third Law."},{"id":492,"text":"It went: A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws."},{"id":493,"text":"It would not trouble Daneel to be destroyed if the alternative were breaking the First Law."},{"id":494,"text":"And Baley did not wish, to destroy Daneel."},{"id":495,"text":"Definitely not. -\r\n\r\nYet he did want to see out the car."},{"id":496,"text":"It was becoming an obsession with him."},{"id":497,"text":"He couldn't allow this nurse-infant relationship to build up."},{"id":498,"text":"For a moment he thought of pointing the blaster at his own temple."},{"id":499,"text":"Open the car top or I'll kill myself."},{"id":500,"text":"Oppose one application of the First Law by a greater and more immediate one."},{"id":501,"text":"Baley knew he couldn't do it."},{"id":502,"text":"Too undignified."},{"id":503,"text":"He disliked the picture conjured up by the thought."},{"id":504,"text":"He said wearily, \"Would you ask the driver how close in miles we are to destination?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\nDaneel bent forward and pushed the toggle switch."},{"id":505,"text":"But as he did so, Baley leaned forward too, crying out, \"Driver!"},{"id":506,"text":"Lower the top of the car!\"\r\n\r\nAnd it was the human hand that moved quickly to the toggle switch and closed it again."},{"id":507,"text":"The human hand held its place firmly thereafter."},{"id":508,"text":"Panting a bit, Baley stared at Daneel."},{"id":509,"text":"For a second Daneel was motionless, as though his positronic paths were momentarily out of stability in their effort to adjust to the new situation."},{"id":510,"text":"But that passed quickly and then the robot's hand was moving."},{"id":511,"text":"Baley had anticipated that."},{"id":512,"text":"Daneel would remove the human hand from the switch (gently, not hurting it), reactivate the transmitter, and countermand the order."},{"id":513,"text":"Baley said, \"You won't get my hand away without hurting me."},{"id":514,"text":"I warn you."},{"id":515,"text":"You will probably have to break my finger.\"\r\n\r\nThat was not so."},{"id":516,"text":"Baley knew that."},{"id":517,"text":"But Daneel's movements stopped."},{"id":518,"text":"Harm against harm."},{"id":519,"text":"The positronic brain had to weigh probabilities and translate them into opposing potentials."},{"id":520,"text":"It meant just a bit more hesitation."},{"id":521,"text":"Baley said, \"It's too late.\"\r\n\r\nHis race was won."},{"id":522,"text":"The top was sliding back and pouring into the car, flow open, was the harsh white light of Solaria's sun."},{"id":523,"text":"Baley wanted to shut his eyes in initial terror, but fought the sensation."},{"id":524,"text":"He faced the enormous wash of blue and green, incredible\r\n\r\nquantities of it."},{"id":525,"text":"He could feel the undisciplined rush of air against his face, but could make out no details of anything."},{"id":526,"text":"A moving something flashed past."},{"id":527,"text":"It might have been a robot or an animal or an unliving something caught in a puff of air."},{"id":528,"text":"He couldn't tell."},{"id":529,"text":"The car went past it too quickly."},{"id":530,"text":"Blue, green, air, noise, motion-and over it all, beating down, furiously, relentlessly, frighteningly, was the white light that came from a ball in the sky."},{"id":531,"text":"For one fleeting split moment he bent his head back and stared directly at Solaria's sun."},{"id":532,"text":"He stared at it, unprotected by the diffusing glass of the Cities' uppermost-Level sun-porches."},{"id":533,"text":"He stared at the naked sun."},{"id":534,"text":"And at the very moment he felt Daneel's hands clamping down upon his shoulders."},{"id":535,"text":"His mind crowded with thought during that unreal, whirling moment."},{"id":536,"text":"He had to see!"},{"id":537,"text":"He had to see all he could."},{"id":538,"text":"And Daneel must be there with him to keep him from seeing."},{"id":539,"text":"But surely a robot would not dare use violence on a man."},{"id":540,"text":"That thought was dominant."},{"id":541,"text":"Daneel could not prevent him forcibly, and yet Baley felt the robot's hands forcing him down."},{"id":542,"text":"Baley lifted his arms to force those fleshless hands away and lost all sensation."},{"id":543,"text":"BALEY WAS back in the safety of enclosure."},{"id":544,"text":"Daneel's face wavered before his eyes, and it was splotched with dark spots that turned to red when he blinked."},{"id":545,"text":"Baley said, \"What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"I regret,\" said Daneel, \"that you have suffered harm despite my presence."},{"id":546,"text":"The direct rays of the sun are damaging to the human eye, but I believe that the damage from the short exposure you suffered will not be permanent."},{"id":547,"text":"When you looked up, I was forced to pull you down and you lost consciousness.\"\r\n\r\nBaley grimaced."},{"id":548,"text":"That left the question open as to whether he had fainted out of overexcitement (or fright?) or had been knocked unconscious."},{"id":549,"text":"He felt his jaw and head and found no pain."},{"id":550,"text":"He forbore asking the question direct."},{"id":551,"text":"In a way he didn't want to know."},{"id":552,"text":"He said, \"It wasn't so bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"From your reactions, Partner Elijah, I should judge you had found it unpleasant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Baley stubbornly."},{"id":553,"text":"The splotches before his eyes were fading and they weren't tearing so. \"I'm only sorry I saw so little."},{"id":554,"text":"We were moving too fast."},{"id":555,"text":"Did we pass a robot?\"\r\n\r\n\"We passed a number of them."},{"id":556,"text":"We are traveling across the Kinbald estate, which is given over to fruit orchards.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to try again,\" said Baley.\r\n\r\n\"You must not, in my presence,\" said Daneel. \"Meanwhile, I have done as you requested.\"\r\n\r\n\"As I requested?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will remember, Partner Elijah, that before you ordered the\r\n\r\ndriver to lower the top of the car, you had ordered me to ask the driver how close in miles we were to destination."},{"id":557,"text":"We are ten miles away now and shall be there in some six minutes.\"\r\n\r\nBaley felt the impulse to ask Daneel if he were angry at having been outwitted if only to see that perfect face become imperfect, but he repressed it."},{"id":558,"text":"Of course Daneel would simply answer no, without rancor or annoyance."},{"id":559,"text":"He would sit there as calm and as grave as ever, unperturbed and imperturbable."},{"id":560,"text":"Baley said quietly, \"Just the same, Daneel, I'll have to get used to it, you know.\"\r\n\r\nThe robot regarded his human partner. \"To what is it that you refer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jehoshaphat!"},{"id":561,"text":"To the-the outdoors."},{"id":562,"text":"It's all this planet is made of.\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be no necessity for facing the outdoors,\" said Daneel."},{"id":563,"text":"Then, as though that disposed of the subject, he said, '\"We are slowing down, Partner Elijah."},{"id":564,"text":"I believe we have arrived."},{"id":565,"text":"It will be necessary to wait now for the connection of another air-tube leading to the dwelling that will serve as our base of operations.\"\r\n\r\n\"An air-tube is unnecessary, Daneel."},{"id":566,"text":"If I am to be working outdoors, there is no point in delaying the indoctrination.\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be no reason for you to work outdoors, Partner Elijah.\" The robot started to say more, but Baley waved him quiet with a peremptory motion of the hand."},{"id":567,"text":"At the moment he was not in the mood for Daneel's careful consolations, for soothings, for assurances that all would be well and that he would be taken care of."},{"id":568,"text":"What he really wanted was an inner knowledge that he could take care of himself and fulfill his assignment."},{"id":569,"text":"The sight and feel of the open had been hard to take."},{"id":570,"text":"It might be that when the time came he would lack the hardihood to dare face it again, at the cost of his self-respect and, conceivably, of Earth's safety."},{"id":571,"text":"All over a small matter of emptiness."},{"id":572,"text":"His face grew grim even at the glancing touch of that thought."},{"id":573,"text":"He would face air, sun, and empty space yet!"},{"id":574,"text":"Elijah Baley felt like an inhabitant of one of the smaller Cities, say Helsinki, visiting New York and counting the Levels in awe."},{"id":575,"text":"He had thought of a \"dwelling\" as something like an apartment unit, but this was nothing like it at all."},{"id":576,"text":"He passed from room to room end-\r\n\r\nlessly."},{"id":577,"text":"Panoramic windows were shrouded closely, allowing no hint of disturbing day to enter."},{"id":578,"text":"Lights came to life noiselessly from hidden sources as they stepped into a room and died again as quietly when they left.\r\n\r\n\"So many rooms,\" said Baley with wonder. \"So many."},{"id":579,"text":"It's like a very tiny City, Daneel.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would seem so, Partner Elijah,\" said Daneel with equanimity."},{"id":580,"text":"It seemed strange to the Earthman."},{"id":581,"text":"Why was it necessary to crowd so many Spacers together with him in close quarters?"},{"id":582,"text":"He said, \"How many will be living here with me?\"\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"There will be myself, of course, and a number of robots.\"\r\n\r\nBaley thought: He ought to have said, a number of other robots."},{"id":583,"text":"Again he found it obvious that Daneel had the intention of playing the man thoroughly even for no other audience than Baley, who knew the truth so well."},{"id":584,"text":"And then that thought popped into nothing under the force of a second, more urgent one."},{"id":585,"text":"He cried, \"Robots?"},{"id":586,"text":"How many humans?\"\r\n\r\n\"None, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\nThey had just stepped into a room, crowded from floor to ceiling with book films."},{"id":587,"text":"Three fixed viewers with lar-ge twenty-four-inch viewing panels set vertically were in three corners of the room."},{"id":588,"text":"The fourth contained an animation screen."},{"id":589,"text":"Baley looked about in annoyance."},{"id":590,"text":"He said, \"Did they kick everyone out just to leave me rattling around alone in this mausoleum?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is meant only for you."},{"id":591,"text":"A dwelling such as this for one person is customary on Solaria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everyone lives like this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everyone.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do they need all the rooms for?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is customary to devote a single room to a single purpose."},{"id":592,"text":"This is the library."},{"id":593,"text":"There is also a music room, a gymnasium, a kitchen, a bakery, a dining room, a machine shop, various robot-repair and testing rooms, two bedrooms-\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop!"},{"id":594,"text":"How do you know all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is part of the information pattern,\" said Daneel smoothly, \"made available to me before I left Aurora.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jehoshaphat!"},{"id":595,"text":"Who takes care of all of this?\" He swung his arm in a wide arc.\r\n\r\n\"There are a number of household robots."},{"id":596,"text":"They have been assigned to you and will see to it that you are comfortable.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't need all this,\" said Baley."},{"id":597,"text":"He had the urge to sit down and refuse to budge."},{"id":598,"text":"He wanted to see no more rooms.\r\n\r\n\"We can remain in one room if you so desire, Partner Elijah."},{"id":599,"text":"That was visualized as a possibility from the start."},{"id":600,"text":"Nevertheless, Solarian customs being what they are, it was considered wiser to allow this house to be built--\"\r\n\r\n\"Built!\" Baley stared. \"You mean this was built for me?"},{"id":601,"text":"All this?"},{"id":602,"text":"Specially?\"\r\n\r\n\"A thoroughly roboticized economy--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I see what you're going to say."},{"id":603,"text":"What will they do with the house when all this is over?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe they will tear it down.\"\r\n\r\nBaley's lips clamped together."},{"id":604,"text":"Of course!"},{"id":605,"text":"Tear it down!"},{"id":606,"text":"Build a tremendous structure for the special use of one Earthman and then tear down everything he touched."},{"id":607,"text":"Sterilize the soil the house stood on!"},{"id":608,"text":"Fumigate the air he breathed!"},{"id":609,"text":"The Spacers might seem strong, but they, too, had their foolish fears."},{"id":610,"text":"Daneel seemed to read his thoughts, or to interpret his expression at any rate."},{"id":611,"text":"He said, \"It may appear to you, Partner Elijah, that it is to escape contagion that they will destroy the house."},{"id":612,"text":"If such are your thoughts, I suggest that you refrain from making yourself uncomfortable over the matter."},{"id":613,"text":"The fear of disease on the part of Spacers is by no means so extreme."},{"id":614,"text":"It is just that the effort involved in building the house is, to them, very little."},{"id":615,"text":"Nor does the waste involved in tearing it down once more seem great to them.\r\n\r\n\"And by law, Partner Elijah, this place cannot be allowed to remain standing."},{"id":616,"text":"It is on the estate of Hannis Gruer and there can only be one legal dwelling place on any estate, that of the owner."},{"id":617,"text":"This house was built by special dispensation, for a specific purpose."},{"id":618,"text":"It is meant to house us for a specific length of time, till our mission is completed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is Hannis Gruer?\" asked Baley.\r\n\r\n\"The head of Solarian security."},{"id":619,"text":"We are to see him on arrival.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we?"},{"id":620,"text":"Jehoshaphat, Daneel, when do I begin to learn anything at all about anything?"},{"id":621,"text":"I'm working in a vacuum and I don't like it."},{"id":622,"text":"I might as well go back to Earth."},{"id":623,"text":"I might as well-\"\r\n\r\nHe felt himself working up into resentment and cut himself short."},{"id":624,"text":"Daneel never wavered."},{"id":625,"text":"He merely waited his chance to speak."},{"id":626,"text":"He said, \"I regret the fact that you are annoyed."},{"id":627,"text":"My general knowledge of Solaria does seem to be greater than yours."},{"id":628,"text":"My knowledge of the murder case itself is as limited as is your own."},{"id":629,"text":"It is Agent Gruer who will tell us what we must know."},{"id":630,"text":"The Solarian Government has arranged this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, let's get to this Gruer."},{"id":631,"text":"How long a trip will it be?\" Baley winced at th ~ thought of more travel and the familiar constriction in his chest was making itself felt again."},{"id":632,"text":"Daneel said, \"No travel is necessary, Partner Elijah."},{"id":633,"text":"Agent Gruer will be waiting for us in the conversation room.\"\r\n\r\n\"A room for conversation, too?\" Baley murmured wryly."},{"id":634,"text":"Then, in a louder voice, \"Waiting for us now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let's get to him, Daneel!\"\r\n\r\nHannis Gruer was bald, and that without qualification."},{"id":635,"text":"There was not even a fringe o1~ hair at the sides of his skull."},{"id":636,"text":"It was completely naked."},{"id":637,"text":"Baley swallowed and tried, out of politeness, to keep his eyes off that skull, but couldn't."},{"id":638,"text":"On Earth there was the continuous acceptance of Spacers at the Spacers' own evaluation: The Spacers were the unquestioned lords of the Galaxy; they were tall, bronze of skin and hair, handsome, large, cool, aristocratic."},{"id":639,"text":"In short, they were all R."},{"id":640,"text":"Daneel Olivaw was, but with the fact of humanity in addition."},{"id":641,"text":"And the Spacers who were sent to Earth often did look like that; perhaps were deliberately chosen for that reason."},{"id":642,"text":"But here was a Spacer who might have been an Earthman for all his appearance."},{"id":643,"text":"He was bald."},{"id":644,"text":"And his nose was misshapen, too."},{"id":645,"text":"Not much, to be sure, but on a Spacer even a slight asymmetry was noteworthy."},{"id":646,"text":"Baley said, \"Gocd afternoon, sir."},{"id":647,"text":"I am sorry if we kept you waiting.\"\r\n\r\nNo harm in politeness."},{"id":648,"text":"He would have to work with these people."},{"id":649,"text":"He had the momentary urge to step across the expanse of room (how ridiculously large) and offer his hand in greeting."},{"id":650,"text":"It was an urge easy to fight off."},{"id":651,"text":"A Spacer certainly would not welcome such a greeting: a hand covered with Earthly germs?"},{"id":652,"text":"Gruer sat gravely, as far away from Baley as he could get, his\r\n\r\nhands resting within long sleeves, and probably there were filters in his nostrils, although Baley couldn't see them."},{"id":653,"text":"It even seemed to him that Gruer cast a disapproving look at Daneel as though to say: You're a queer Spacer, standing that close to an Earthman."},{"id":654,"text":"That would mean Gruer simply did not know the truth."},{"id":655,"text":"Then Baley noticed suddenly that Daneel was standing at some distance, at that; farther than he usually did."},{"id":656,"text":"Of course!"},{"id":657,"text":"Too close, and Gruer might find the proximity unbelievable."},{"id":658,"text":"Daneel was intent on being accepted as human."},{"id":659,"text":"Gruer spoke in a pleasant, friendly voice, but his eyes tended to remain furtively on Daneel; looking away, then drifting back."},{"id":660,"text":"He said, \"I haven't been waiting long."},{"id":661,"text":"Welcome to Solaria, gentlemen."},{"id":662,"text":"Are you comfortable?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir."},{"id":663,"text":"Quite,\" said Baley."},{"id":664,"text":"He wondered if etiquette would require that Daneel as the \"Spacer\" should speak for the two, but reje~ted that possibility recentfully."},{"id":665,"text":"Jehoshaphat!"},{"id":666,"text":"It was he, himself, who had been req'iested for the investigation and Daneel had been added afterward."},{"id":667,"text":"Under the circumstances Baley felt he would not play the secondary to a genuine Spacer; it was out of the question when a robot was involved, even such a robot as Daneel."},{"id":668,"text":"But Daneel made no attempt to take precedence over Ba'ey, nor did Gruer seem surprised or displeased at that."},{"id":669,"text":"Instead, he turned his attention at once to Baley to the exclusion of Daneel."},{"id":670,"text":"Gruer said, \"You have been told nothing, Plainclothesman Baley, about the crime for which your services have been solicited."},{"id":671,"text":"I imagine you are quite curious about that.\" He shook his arms so that the sleeves fell backward and clasped his hands loosely in his lap. \"Won't you gentlemen sit down?\"\r\n\r\nThey did so and Baley said, \"We are curious.\" He noted that Gruer's hands were not protected by g'oves."},{"id":672,"text":"Gruer went on. \"That was on purpose, Plainclothesman."},{"id":673,"text":"We wanted you to arrive here prepared to tackle the problem with a fresh mind."},{"id":674,"text":"We wanted no preconceived notions."},{"id":675,"text":"You will have available to you shortly a full report of the details of the crime and of the investigations we have been able to conduct."},{"id":676,"text":"I am afraid, Plainclothesman, that you will find our investigations ridicu1ously incomplete from the standpoint of your own experience."},{"id":677,"text":"We have no police force on Solaria.\"\r\n\r\n\"None at all?\" asked Baley."},{"id":678,"text":"Gruer smiled and shrugged. \"No crime, you see."},{"id":679,"text":"Our population is tiny and widely scattered."},{"id":680,"text":"There is no occasion \"for crime; therefore no occasion for police.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see."},{"id":681,"text":"But for all that, you do have crime now.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, but the first crime of violence in two centuries of history.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunate, then, that you must begin with murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunate, yes."},{"id":682,"text":"More unfortunately still, the victim was a man we could scarcely afford to lose."},{"id":683,"text":"A most inappropriate victim."},{"id":684,"text":"And the circumstances of the murder were particularly brutal.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"I suppose the murderer is completely unknown.\" (Why else would the crime be worth the importation of an Earthly detective?)\r\n\r\nGruer looked particularly uneasy."},{"id":685,"text":"He glanced sideways at Daneel, who sat motionless, an absorptive, quiet mechanism."},{"id":686,"text":"Baley knew that Daneel would, at any time in the future, be able to reproduce any conversation he heard, of whatever length."},{"id":687,"text":"He was a recording machine that walked and talked like a man."},{"id":688,"text":"Did Gruer know that?"},{"id":689,"text":"His look at Daneel had certainly something of the furtive about it."},{"id":690,"text":"Gruer said, \"No, I cannot say the murderer is completely unknown."},{"id":691,"text":"In fact, there is only one person that can possibly have done the deed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure you don't mean only one person who is likely to have done the deed?\" Baley distrusted overstatement and had no liking for the armchair deducer who discovered certainty rather than probability in the workings of logic."},{"id":692,"text":"But Gruer shook his bald head. \"No."},{"id":693,"text":"Only one possible person."},{"id":694,"text":"Anyone else is impossible."},{"id":695,"text":"Completely impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Completely?\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have no problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary."},{"id":696,"text":"We do have a problem."},{"id":697,"text":"That one person couldn't have done it either.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said calmly, \"Then no one did it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet the deed was done."},{"id":698,"text":"Rikaine Delmarre is dead.\"\r\n\r\nThat's something, thought Baley."},{"id":699,"text":"Jehoshaphat, I've got something."},{"id":700,"text":"I've got the victim's name."},{"id":701,"text":"He brought out his notebook and solemnly made note of it, partly\r\n\r\nout of a wry desire to indicate that he had scraped up, at last, a nubbin of fact, and partly to avoid making it too obvious that he sat by the side of a

spelled that as it sounded and let it go."},{"id":703,"text":"He said, \"Now who would be able to give me a personal account of the circumstances surrounding the murder?"},{"id":704,"text":"As firsthand as possible.\"\r\n\r\nGruer's smile was grim and his eyes shifted to Daneel again, and then away. \"His wife, Plainclothesman.\"\r\n\r\n\"His wife . . .\r\n\r\n\"Yes."},{"id":705,"text":"Her name is Gladia.\" Gruer pronounced it in three syllables, accenting the second.\r\n\r\n\"Any children?\" Baley's eyes were fixed on his notebook."},{"id":706,"text":"When no answer came, he looked up. \"Any children?\"\r\n\r\nBut Gruer's mouth had pursed up as though he had tasted something sour."},{"id":707,"text":"He looked sick."},{"id":708,"text":"Finally he said, \"I would scarcely know.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"What?\"\r\n\r\nGruer added hastily, \"In any case, I think you had better postpone actual operations till tomorrow."},{"id":709,"text":"I know you've had a hard trip, Mr."},{"id":710,"text":"Baley, and that you are tired and probably hungry.\"\r\n\r\nBaley, about to deny it, realized suddenly that the thought of food had an uncommon attraction for him at the moment."},{"id":711,"text":"He said, \"Will you join us at our meal?\" He didn't think Gruer would, being a Spacer. (Yet he had been brought to the point of saying \"Mr."},{"id":712,"text":"Baley\" rather than \"Plainclothesman Baley,\" which was something.)\r\n\r\nAs expected, Gruer said, \"A business engagement makes that impossible."},{"id":713,"text":"I will have to leave."},{"id":714,"text":"I am sorry.\"\r\n\r\nBaley rose."},{"id":715,"text":"The polite thing would be to accompany Gruer to the door."},{"id":716,"text":"In the first place, however, he wasn't at all anxious to approach the door and the unprotected open."},{"id":717,"text":"And in the second he wasn't sure where the door was."},{"id":718,"text":"He remained standing in uncertainty."},{"id":719,"text":"Cruet smiled and nodded."},{"id":720,"text":"He said, \"I will see you again."},{"id":721,"text":"Your robots will know the combination if you wish to talk to me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he was gone."},{"id":722,"text":"Baley exclaimed sharply."},{"id":723,"text":"Cruet and the chair he was sitting on were simply not there."},{"id":724,"text":"The wall behind Cruer, the floor under his feet changed with explosive suddenness. -\r\n\r\nDaneel said calmly, \"He was not there in the flesh at any time."},{"id":725,"text":"It was a trimensional image."},{"id":726,"text":"It seemed to me you would know."},{"id":727,"text":"You have such things on Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not like this,\" muttered Baley."},{"id":728,"text":"A trimensional image on Earth was encased in a cubic force-field that glittered against the background."},{"id":729,"text":"The image itself had a tiny flicker."},{"id":730,"text":"On Earth there was no mistaking image for reality."},{"id":731,"text":"Here."},{"id":732,"text":"No wonder Gruer had worn no gloves."},{"id":733,"text":"He needed no nose filters, for that matter."},{"id":734,"text":"Daneel said, \"Would you care to eat now, Partner Elijah?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDinner was an unexpected ordeal."},{"id":735,"text":"Robots appeared."},{"id":736,"text":"One set the table."},{"id":737,"text":"One brought in the food.\r\n\r\n\"How many are there in the house, Daneel?\" Baley asked.\r\n\r\n\"About fifty, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will they stay here while we eat?\" (One had backed into a corner, his glossy, glowing-eyed face turned toward Baley.)\r\n\r\n\"It is the usual practice,\" said Daneel, \"for one to do so in case its service is called upon."},{"id":738,"text":"If you do not wish that, you have only to order it to leave.\"\r\n\r\nBaley shrugged. \"Let it stay!\"\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions Baley might have found the food delicious."},{"id":739,"text":"Now he ate mechanically."},{"id":740,"text":"He noted abstractedly that Daneel ate also, with a kind of unimpassioned efficiency."},{"id":741,"text":"Later on, of course, he would empty the fluorocarbon sac within him into which the \"eaten\" food was now being stored."},{"id":742,"text":"Meanwhile Daneel maintained his masquerade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is it night outside?\" asked Baley.\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" replied Daneel."},{"id":743,"text":"Baley stared somberly at the bed."},{"id":744,"text":"It was too large."},{"id":745,"text":"The whole bedroom was too large."},{"id":746,"text":"There were no blankets to burrow under, only sheets."},{"id":747,"text":"They would make a poor enclosure."},{"id":748,"text":"Everything was difficult!"},{"id":749,"text":"He had already gone through the Unnerving experience of showering in a stall that actually adjoined\r\n\r\nthe bedroom."},{"id":750,"text":"It was the height of luxury in a way, yet, on the other hand, it seemed an unsanitary arrangement."},{"id":751,"text":"He said abruptly, \"How is the light put out?\" The headboard of the bed gleamed with a soft light."},{"id":752,"text":"Perhaps that was to facilitate book viewing before sleeping, but Baley was in no mood for that.\r\n\r\n\"It will be taken care of once you're in bed, if you compose yourself for sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"The robots watch, do they?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is their job.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jehoshaphat!"},{"id":753,"text":"What do these Solarians do for themselves?\" Baley muttered. \"I wonder now why a robot didn't scrub my back in the shower.\"\r\n\r\nWith no trace of humor Daneel said, \"One would have, had you required it."},{"id":754,"text":"As for the Solarians, they do what they choose."},{"id":755,"text":"No robot performs his duty if ordered not to, except, of course, where the performance is necessary to the well-being of the human.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, good night, Daneel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be in another bedroom, Partner Elijah."},{"id":756,"text":"If, at any time during the night, you need anything--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know."},{"id":757,"text":"The robots will come.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a contact patch on the side table."},{"id":758,"text":"You have only to touch it."},{"id":759,"text":"I will come too.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSleep eluded Baley."},{"id":760,"text":"He kept picturing the house he was in, balanced precariously at the outer skin of the world, with emptiness waiting just outside like a monster."},{"id":761,"text":"On Earth his apartment-his snug, comfortable, crowded apartment-sat nestled beneath many others."},{"id":762,"text":"There were dozens of Levels and thousands of people between himself and the rim of Earth."},{"id":763,"text":"Even on Earth, he tried to tell himself, there were people on the topmost Level."},{"id":764,"text":"They would be immediately adjacent to the outside."},{"id":765,"text":"Sure!"},{"id":766,"text":"But that's what made those apartments low-rent."},{"id":767,"text":"Then he thought of Jessie, a thousand light-years away."},{"id":768,"text":"He wanted terribly to get out of bed right now, dress, and walk\r\n\r\nto her."},{"id":769,"text":"His thoughts grew mistier."},{"id":770,"text":"If there were only a tunnel, a\r\n\r\nnice, safe tunnel burrowing its way through safe, solid rock and\r\n\r\nmetal from Solaria to Earth, he would walk and walk and walk. . ."},{"id":771,"text":"He would walk back to Earth, back to Jessie, back to comfort and\r\n\r\nsecurity. - ."},{"id":772,"text":"Security."},{"id":773,"text":"Baley's eyes opened."},{"id":774,"text":"His arms grew rigid and he rose up on his elbow, scarcely aware that he was Joing so."},{"id":775,"text":"Security!"},{"id":776,"text":"This man, Hannis Cruer, was head of Solarian security."},{"id":777,"text":"So Daneel had said."},{"id":778,"text":"What did \"security\" mean?"},{"id":779,"text":"If it meant the same as it meant on Earth, and surely it must, this man Cruer was responsible for the protection of Solaria against invasion from without and subversion from within."},{"id":780,"text":"Why was he interested in a murder case?"},{"id":781,"text":"Was it because there were no police on Solaria and the Department of Security would come the closest to knowing what to do about a murder?"},{"id":782,"text":"Cruer had seemed at ease with Baley, yet there had been those furtive glances, again and again, in the direction of Daneel."},{"id":783,"text":"Did Cruer suspect the motives of Daneel?"},{"id":784,"text":"Baley, himself, had been ordered to keep his eyes open and Daneel might very likely have received similar instructions."},{"id":785,"text":"It would be natural for Gruer to suspect that espionage was possible."},{"id":786,"text":"His job made it necessary for him to suspect that in any case where it was conceivable."},{"id":787,"text":"And he would not fear Baley overmuch, an Earthman, representative of the least formidable world in the\r\n\r\nGalaxy. -\r\n\r\nBut Daneel was a native of Aurora, the oldest and largest and strongest of the Outer Worlds."},{"id":788,"text":"That would be different."},{"id":789,"text":"Cruer, as Baley now remembered, had not addressed one word to Daneel."},{"id":790,"text":"For that matter, why should Daneel pretend so thoroughly to be a man?"},{"id":791,"text":"The earlier explanation that Baley had posed for himself, that it was a vainglorious game on the part of Daneel's Auroran designers, seemed trivial."},{"id":792,"text":"It seemed obvious now that the masquerade was something more serious."},{"id":793,"text":"A man could be expected to receive diplomatic immunity; a certain courtesy and gentleness of treatment."},{"id":794,"text":"A robot could not."},{"id":795,"text":"But then why did not Aurora send a real man in the first place."},{"id":796,"text":"Why gamble so desperately on a fake?"},{"id":797,"text":"The answer suggested itself instantly to Baley."},{"id":798,"text":"A real man of Aurora, a real Spacer, would not care to associate too closely or for too long a time with an Earthman."},{"id":799,"text":"But if all this were true, why should Solaria find a single murder so important that it must allow an Earthman and an Auroran to come to their planet?"},{"id":800,"text":"Baley felt trapped."},{"id":801,"text":"He was trapped on Solaria by the necessities of his assignment."},{"id":802,"text":"He was trapped by Earth's danger, trapped in an environment he\r\n\r\ncould scarcely endure, trapped by a responsibility he could not shirk."},{"id":803,"text":"And, to add to all this, he was trapped somehow in the midst of a\r\n\r\nSpacer conffict the nature of which he did not understand."},{"id":804,"text":"HE SLEPT at last."},{"id":805,"text":"He did not remember when he actually made the transition to sleep."},{"id":806,"text":"There was just a period when his thoughts grew more erratic and then the headboard of his bed was shining and the ceiling was alight with a cool, daytime glow."},{"id":807,"text":"He looked at his watch."},{"id":808,"text":"Hours had passed."},{"id":809,"text":"The robots who ran the house had decided it was time for him to wake up and had acted accordingly."},{"id":810,"text":"He wondered if Daneel were awake and at once realized the illogic of the thought."},{"id":811,"text":"Daneel could not sleep."},{"id":812,"text":"Baley wondered if he had counterfeited sleep as part of the role he was playing."},{"id":813,"text":"Had he undressed and put on nightclothes?"},{"id":814,"text":"As though on cue Daneel entered. \"Good morning, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\nThe robot was completely dressed and his face was in perfect repose."},{"id":815,"text":"He said, \"Did you sleep well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Baley diyly, \"did you?\"\r\n\r\nHe got out of bed and tramped into the bathroom for a shave and for the remainder of the morning ritual."},{"id":816,"text":"He shouted, \"If a robot comes in to shave me, send him out again."},{"id":817,"text":"They get on my nerves."},{"id":818,"text":"Even if I don't see them, they get on my nerves.\"\r\n\r\nHe stared at his own face as he shaved, marveling a bit that it looked so like the mirrored face he saw on Earth."},{"id":819,"text":"If only the image were another Earthman with whom he could consult instead of only the light-mimicry of himself."},{"id":820,"text":"If he could go over what he had already learned, small as it was. .\r\n\r\n\"Too small!"},{"id":821,"text":"Get more,\" he muttered to the mirror."},{"id":822,"text":"He came out, mopping his face, and pulled trousers over fresh shorts. (Robots supplied everything, damn them.)\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Would you answer a few questions, Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\"As you know, Partner Elijah, I answer all questions to the best of my knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nOr to the letter of your instructions, thought Baley."},{"id":823,"text":"He said, \"Why are there only twenty thousand people on Solaria?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a mere fact,\" said Daneel. \"A datum."},{"id":824,"text":"A figure that is the result of a counting process.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but you're evading the matter."},{"id":825,"text":"The planet can support millions; why, then, only twenty thousand?"},{"id":826,"text":"You said the Solarians consider twenty thousand optimum."},{"id":827,"text":"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is their way of life.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean they practice birth control?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And leave the planet empty?\" Baley wasn't sure why he was pounding away at this one point, but the planet's population was one of the few hard facts he had learned about it and there was little else he could ask about."},{"id":828,"text":"Daneel said, \"The planet is not empty."},{"id":829,"text":"It is parceled out into estates, each of which is supervised by a Solarian.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean each lives on his estate."},{"id":830,"text":"Twenty thousand estates, each with a Solarian.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fewer estates than those, Partner Elijah."},{"id":831,"text":"Wives share the estate.\"\r\n\r\n\"No Cities?\" Baley felt cold.\r\n\r\n\"None at all, Partner Elijah."},{"id":832,"text":"They live completely apart and never see one another except under the most extraordinary circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hermits?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a way, yes."},{"id":833,"text":"In a way, no.\"\r\n\r\n'\"What does that mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Agent Gruer visited you yesterday by trimensional image."},{"id":834,"text":"Solarfans visit one another freely that way and in no other way.\"\r\n\r\nBaley stared at Daneel."},{"id":835,"text":"He said, \"Does that include us?"},{"id":836,"text":"Are we expected to live that way?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the custom of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how do I investigate this case?"},{"id":837,"text":"If I want to see someone-\"\r\n\r\n\"From this house, Partner Elijah, you can obtain a trimensional view of anyone on the planet."},{"id":838,"text":"There will be no problem."},{"id":839,"text":"In fact, it\r\n\r\nwill save you the annoyance of leaving this house."},{"id":840,"text":"It was why I said when we arrived that there would be no occasIon for you to feel it necessary to grow accustomed to facing the outdoors."},{"id":841,"text":"And that is well."},{"id":842,"text":"Any other arrangement would be most distasteful to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll judge what's distasteful to me,\" said Baley. \"First thing today, Daneel, I get in touch with the Gladia woman, the wife of the murdered man."},{"id":843,"text":"If the trimensional business is unsatisfactory, I will go out to her place, personally."},{"id":844,"text":"It's a matter for my decision.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall see what is best and most feasible, Partner Elijah,\" said Daneel noncommittally. \"I shall arrange for breakfast.\" He turned to leave."},{"id":845,"text":"Baley stared at the broad robotic back and was almost amused."},{"id":846,"text":"Daneel Olivaw acted the master."},{"id":847,"text":"If his instructions had been to keep Baley from learning any more than was absolutely necessary, a trump card had been left in Baley's hand."},{"id":848,"text":"The other was only R."},{"id":849,"text":"Daneel Olivaw, after all."},{"id":850,"text":"All that was necessary was to tell Gruer, or any Solarian, that Daneel was a robot and not a man."},{"id":851,"text":"And yet, on the other hand, Daneel's pseudo humanity could be of great use, too."},{"id":852,"text":"A trump card need not be played at once."},{"id":853,"text":"Sometimes it was more useful in the hand."},{"id":854,"text":"Wait and see, he thought, and followed Daneel out to breakfast."},{"id":855,"text":"Baley said, \"Now how does one go about establishing trimensional contact?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is done for us, Partner Elijah,\" said Daneel, and his finger sought out one of the contact patches that summoned robots."},{"id":856,"text":"A robot entered at once."},{"id":857,"text":"Where do they come from, Baley wondered."},{"id":858,"text":"As one wandered aimlessly about the uninhabited maze that constituted the mansion, not one robot was ever visible."},{"id":859,"text":"Did they scramble out of the way as humans approached?"},{"id":860,"text":"Did they send messages to one another and clear the path?"},{"id":861,"text":"Yet whenever a call went out, one appeared without delay."},{"id":862,"text":"Baley stared at the robotic newcomer."},{"id":863,"text":"It was sleek, but not glossy."},{"id":864,"text":"Its surface had a muted, grayish finish, with a checkerboard pattern on the right shoulder as the only bit of color."},{"id":865,"text":"Squares in white and yellow (silver and gold, really, from the metallic luster) were placed in what seemed an aimless pattern."},{"id":866,"text":"Daneel said, \"Take us to the conversation room.\" The robot bowed and turned, but said nothing."},{"id":867,"text":"Baley said, \"Wait, boy."},{"id":868,"text":"What's your name?\"\r\n\r\nThe robot faced Baley."},{"id":869,"text":"It spoke in clear tones and without hesitation. \"I have no name, master."},{"id":870,"text":"My serial number\"-and a metal finger lifted and rested on the shoulder patch-\"is ACX-z745.\"\r\n\r\nDaneel and Baley followed into a large room, which Baley recognized as having held Gruer and his chair the day before."},{"id":871,"text":"Another robot was waiting for them with the eternal, patient nonboredom of the machine."},{"id":872,"text":"The first bowed and left."},{"id":873,"text":"Baley compared shoulder patches of the two as the first bowed and started out."},{"id":874,"text":"The pattern of silver and gold was different."},{"id":875,"text":"The checkerboard was made up of a six-by-six square."},{"id":876,"text":"The number of possible arrangements would be ~ then, or seventy billion."},{"id":877,"text":"More than enough."},{"id":878,"text":"Baley said, \"Apparently, there is one robot for everything."},{"id":879,"text":"One to show us here."},{"id":880,"text":"One to run the viewer.\"\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"There is much robotic specialization in Solaria, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\"With so many of them, I can understand why.\" Baley looked at the second robot."},{"id":881,"text":"Except for the shoulder patch, and, presumably, for the invisible positronic patterns within its spongy platinumiridium brain it was the duplicate of the first."},{"id":882,"text":"He said, \"And your serial number?\"\r\n\r\n\"ACC- i i z~, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll just call you boy."},{"id":883,"text":"Now I want to speak to a Mrs."},{"id":884,"text":"Gladia Delmarre, wife of the late Rikaine Delmarre-- Daneel, is there an address, some way of pin-pointing her location?\"\r\n\r\nDaneel said gently, \"I do not believe any further information is necessary."},{"id":885,"text":"If I may question the robot-\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me do that,\" Baley said. \"All right, boy, do you know how the lady is to be reached?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master."},{"id":886,"text":"I have knowledge of the connection pattern of all masters.\" This was said without pride."},{"id":887,"text":"It was a mere fact, as though it were saying: I am made of metal, master."},{"id":888,"text":"Daneel interposed, \"That is not surprising, Partner Elijah."},{"id":889,"text":"There are less than ten thousand connections that need be fed into the memory circuits, and that is a small number.\"\r\n\r\nBaley nodded. \"Is there more than one Gladia Delmarre, by any chance?"},{"id":890,"text":"There might be that chance of confusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Master?\" After the question the robot remained blankly silent.\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" said Daneel, \"that this robot does not understand your question."},{"id":891,"text":"It is my belief that duplicate names do not occur on Solana."},{"id":892,"text":"Names are registered at birth and no name may be adopted unless it is unoccupied at the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Baley, \"we learn something every minute."},{"id":893,"text":"Now see here, boy, you tell me how to work whatever it is I am supposed to work; give me the connection pattern, or whatever you call it, and then step out.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a perceptible pause before the robot answered."},{"id":894,"text":"It said, \"Do you wish to make contact yourself, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right.\"\r\n\r\nDaneel touched Baley's sleeve gently. \"One moment, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my belief that the robot could make the necessary contact with greater ease."},{"id":895,"text":"It is his specialization.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said grimly, \"I'm sure he can do it better than I can."},{"id":896,"text":"Doing it myself, I may make a mess of it.\" He stared levelly at the impassive Daneel. \"Just the same, I prefer to make contact myself."},{"id":897,"text":"Do I give the orders or don't I?\"\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"You give the orders, Partner Elijah, and your orders, where First Law permits, will be obeyed."},{"id":898,"text":"However, with your permission, I would like to give you what pertinent information I have concerning the Solarian robots."},{"id":899,"text":"Far more than on any other world, the robots on Solaria are specialized."},{"id":900,"text":"Although Solarian robots are physically capable of many things, they are heavily equipped mentally for one particular type of job."},{"id":901,"text":"To perform functions outside their specialty requires the high potentials produced by direct application of one of the Three Laws."},{"id":902,"text":"Again, for them not to perform the duty for which they are equipped also requires the direct application of the Three Laws.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, a direct order from me brings the Second Law into play, doesn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"True."},{"id":903,"text":"Yet the potential set up by it is 'unpleasant' to the robot."},{"id":904,"text":"Ordinarily, the matter would not come up, since almost never does a Solarian interfere with the day-to-day workings of a robot."},{"id":905,"text":"For one\r\n\r\nthing, he would not care to do a robot's work; for another, he would feel no need to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you trying to tell me, Daneel, that it hurts the robot to have me do its work?\"\r\n\r\n\"As you know, Partner Elijah, pain in the human sense is not applicable to robotic reactions.\"\r\n\r\nBaley shrugged. \"Then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" went on Daneel, \"the experience which the robot undergoes is as upsetting to it as pain is to a human, as nearly as I can judge.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" said Baley, \"I'm not a Solarian."},{"id":906,"text":"I'm an Earthman."},{"id":907,"text":"I don't like robots doing what I want to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Consider, too,\" said Daneel, \"that to cause distress to a robot might be considered on the part of our hosts to be an act of impoliteness since in a society such as this there must be a number of more or less rigid beliefs concerning how it is proper to treat a robot and how it is not."},{"id":908,"text":"To offend our hosts would scarcely make our task easier.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Baley. \"Let the robot do its job.\"\r\n\r\nHe settled back."},{"id":909,"text":"The incident had not been without its uses."},{"id":910,"text":"It was an educational example of how remorseless a robotic society could be."},{"id":911,"text":"Once brought into existence, robots were not so easily removed, and a human who wished to dispense with them even temporarily found he could not."},{"id":912,"text":"His eyes half closed, he watched the robot approach the wall."},{"id":913,"text":"Let the sociologists on Earth consider what had just occurred and draw their conclusions."},{"id":914,"text":"He was beginning to have certain notions of his own."},{"id":915,"text":"Half a wall slid aside and the control panel that was revealed would have done justice to a City Section power station."},{"id":916,"text":"Baley longed for his pipe."},{"id":917,"text":"He had been briefed that smoking on non-smoking Solaria would be a terrible breach of decorum, so he had not even been allowed to take his fixings."},{"id":918,"text":"He sighed."},{"id":919,"text":"There were moments when the feel of pipestem between teeth and a warm bowl in his hand would have been infinitely comforting."},{"id":920,"text":"The robot was working quickly, adjusting variable resistances a trifle here and there and intensifying field-forces in proper pattern by quick finger pressures."},{"id":921,"text":"Daneel said, \"It is necessary first to signal the individual one desires to view."},{"id":922,"text":"A robot will, of course, receive the message."},{"id":923,"text":"If the individual being signaled is available and wishes to receive the view, full contact is established.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are all those controls necessary?\" asked Baley. \"The robot's hardly touching most of the panel.\"\r\n\r\n\"My information on the matter is not complete, Partner Elijah."},{"id":924,"text":"There is, however, the necessity of arranging, upon occasion, for multiple viewings and for mobile viewings."},{"id":925,"text":"The latter, particularly, call for complicated and continuing adjustment.\"\r\n\r\nThe robot said, \"Masters, contact is made and approved."},{"id":926,"text":"When you are ready, it will be completed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ready,\" growled Baley, and as though the word were a signal, the far half of the room was alive with light."},{"id":927,"text":"Daneel said at once, \"I neglected to have the robot specify that all visible openings to the outside be draped."},{"id":928,"text":"I regret that and we must arrange--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said Baley, wincing. \"I'll manage."},{"id":929,"text":"Don't interfere.\" It was a bathroom he was staring at, or he judged it to be so from its fixtures."},{"id":930,"text":"One end of it was, he guessed, a kind of beautician's establishment and his imagination pictured a robot (or robots?) working with unerring swiftness on the details of a woman's coiffure and on the externals that made up the picture she presented to the world."},{"id":931,"text":"Some gadgets and fittings he simply gave up on."},{"id":932,"text":"There was no way of judging their purpose in the absence of experience."},{"id":933,"text":"The walls were inlaid with an intricate pattern that all but fooled the eye into believing some natural object was being represented before fading away into an abstraction."},{"id":934,"text":"The result was soothing and almost hypnotic in the way it monopolized attention."},{"id":935,"text":"What might have been the shower stall, a large one, was shielded off by nothing that seemed material, but rather by a trick of lighting that set up a wall of flickering opacity."},{"id":936,"text":"No human was in sight."},{"id":937,"text":"Baley's glance fell to the floor."},{"id":938,"text":"Where did his room end and the other begin?"},{"id":939,"text":"It was easy to tell."},{"id":940,"text":"There was a line where the quality of the light changed and that must be it."},{"id":941,"text":"He stepped toward the line and after a moment's hesitation pushed his hand beyond it."},{"id":942,"text":"He felt nothing, any more than he would have had he shoved the hand into one of Earth's crude trimensionals."},{"id":943,"text":"There, at least, he would have seen his own hand still; faintly, perhaps, and overlaid by the image, but he would have seen it."},{"id":944,"text":"Here it was lost completely."},{"id":945,"text":"To his vision, his arm ended sharply at the wrist."},{"id":946,"text":"What if he stepped across the line altogether?"},{"id":947,"text":"Probably his own vision would become inoperative."},{"id":948,"text":"He would be in a world of complete blackness."},{"id":949,"text":"The thought of such efficient enclosure was almost pleasant."},{"id":950,"text":"A voice interrupted him."},{"id":951,"text":"He looked up and stepped backward with an almost clumsy haste."},{"id":952,"text":"Gladia Delmarre was speaking."},{"id":953,"text":"At least Baley assumed it was she."},{"id":954,"text":"The upper portion of the ffickering light across the shower stall had faded and a head was clearly visible."},{"id":955,"text":"It smiled at Baley. \"I said hello, and I'm sorry to keep you waiting."},{"id":956,"text":"I'll be dry soon.\"\r\n\r\nHers was a triangular face, rather broad at the cheekbones (which grew prominent when she smiled) and narrowing with a gentle curve past full lips to a small chin."},{"id":957,"text":"Her head was not high above the ground."},{"id":958,"text":"Baley judged her to be about five feet two in height. (This was not typical."},{"id":959,"text":"At least not to Baley's way of thinking."},{"id":960,"text":"Spacer women were supposed to lean toward the tall and stately.) Nor was her hair the Spacer bronze."},{"id":961,"text":"It was light brown, tinging toward yeliow, and worn moderately long."},{"id":962,"text":"At the moment it was fluffed out in what Baley imagined must be a stream of warm air."},{"id":963,"text":"The whole picture was quite pleasing."},{"id":964,"text":"Baley said in confusion, \"If you want us to break contact and wait till you're through--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no."},{"id":965,"text":"I'm almost done, and we can talk meanwhile."},{"id":966,"text":"Hannis Gruer told me you would be viewing."},{"id":967,"text":"You're from Earth, I understand.\" Her eyes rested full on him, seemed to drink him in."},{"id":968,"text":"Baley nodded and sat down. \"My companion is from Aurora.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled and kept her glance fixed on Baley as though he remained the curiosity nevertheless, and of course, Baley thought, so he was."},{"id":969,"text":"She lifted her arms above her head, running her fingers through the hair and spreading it out as though to hasten drying."},{"id":970,"text":"Her arms were slim and graceful."},{"id":971,"text":"Very attractive, Baley thought."},{"id":972,"text":"Then he thought uneasily: Jessie wouldn't like this."},{"id":973,"text":"Daneel's voice broke in. \"Would it be possible, Mrs."},{"id":974,"text":"Delmarre, to have the window we see polarized or draped."},{"id":975,"text":"My partner is disturbed by the sight of daylight."},{"id":976,"text":"On Earth, as you may have heard-\"\r\n\r\nThe young woman (Baley judged her to be twenty-five but had the doleful thought that the apparent ages of Spacers could be most deceptive) put her hands to her cheeks and said, \"Oh my, yes."},{"id":977,"text":"I know all about that."},{"id":978,"text":"How ridiculously silly of me."},{"id":979,"text":"Forgive me, please, but it won't take a moment."},{"id":980,"text":"I'll have a robot in here-\"\r\n\r\nShe stepped out of the drying cabinet, her hand extended toward the contact-patch, still talking. \"I'm always thinking I ought to have more than one contact-patch in this room."},{"id":981,"text":"A house is just no good if it doesn't have a patch within reach no matter where you stand- say not more than five feet away."},{"id":982,"text":"It just-- Why, what's the matter?\"\r\n\r\nShe stared in shock at Baley, who, having jumped out of his chair and upset it behind him, had reddened to his hairline and hastily turned away."},{"id":983,"text":"Daneel said calmly, \"It would be better, Mrs."},{"id":984,"text":"Delmarre, if, after you have made contact with the robot, you would return to the stall or, failing that, proceed to put on some articles of clothing.\"\r\n\r\nGladia looked down at her nudity in surprise and said, \"Well, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It was only viewing, you see,\" said Gladia contritely."},{"id":985,"text":"She was wrapped in something that left her arms and shoulders free."},{"id":986,"text":"One leg showed to mid-thigh, but Baley, entirely recovered and feeling an utter fool, ignored it stoically."},{"id":987,"text":"He said, \"It was the surprise, Mrs."},{"id":988,"text":"Delmarre-\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please."},{"id":989,"text":"You can call me Gladia, unless-unless that's against your customs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gladia, then."},{"id":990,"text":"It's all right."},{"id":991,"text":"I just want to assure you there was nothing repulsive about it, you understand."},{"id":992,"text":"Just the surprise.\" Bad enough for him to have acted the fool, he thought, without having the poor girl think he found her unpleasant."},{"id":993,"text":"As a matter of fact, it had been rather-rather."},{"id":994,"text":"Well, he didn't have the phrase, but he knew quite certainly that there was no way he would ever be able to talk of this to Jessie.\r\n\r\n\"I know I offended you,\" Gladia said, \"but I didn't mean to."},{"id":995,"text":"I just wasn't thinking."},{"id":996,"text":"Of course I realize one must be careful about the customs of other planets, but the customs are so queer sometimes; at least, not queer,\" she hastened to add, \"I don't mean queer."},{"id":997,"text":"I mean strange, you know, and it's so easy to forget."},{"id":998,"text":"As 1 forgot about keeping the windows darkened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite all right,\" muttered Baley."},{"id":999,"text":"She was in another room now with all the windows draped and the light had the subtly different and more comfortable texture of artificiality.\r\n\r\n\"But about the other thing,\" she went on earnestly, \"it's just viewing, you see."},{"id":1000,"text":"After all, you didn't mind talking to me when I was in the drier and I wasn't wearing anything then, either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Baley, wishing she would run down as far as that subject was concerned, \"hearing you is one thing, and seeing you is another.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's exactly it."},{"id":1001,"text":"Seeing isn't involved.\" She reddened a trifle and looked down. \"I hope you don't think I'd ever do anything like that, I mean, just step out of the drier, if anyone were seeing me."},{"id":1002,"text":"It was just viewing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Same thing, isn't it?\" said Baley.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all the same thing."},{"id":1003,"text":"You're viewing me right now."},{"id":1004,"text":"You can't touch me, can you, or smell me, or anything like that."},{"id":1005,"text":"You could if you were seeing me."},{"id":1006,"text":"Right now, I'm two hundred miles away from you at least."},{"id":1007,"text":"So how can it be the same thing?\"\r\n\r\nBaley grew interested. \"But I see you with my eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you don't see me."},{"id":1008,"text":"You see my image."},{"id":1009,"text":"You're viewing me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that makes a difference?\"\r\n\r\n\"All the difference there is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see.\" In a way he did."},{"id":1010,"text":"The distinction was not one he could make easily, but it had a kind of logic to it."},{"id":1011,"text":"She said, bending her head a little to one side, \"Do you really see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does that mean you wouldn't mind if I took off my wrapper?\" She was smiling."},{"id":1012,"text":"He thought: She's teasing and I ought to take her up on it."},{"id":1013,"text":"But aloud he said, \"No, it would take my mind off my job."},{"id":1014,"text":"We'll discuss it another time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mind my being in the wrapper, rather than something more formal?"},{"id":1015,"text":"Seriously.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I call you by your first name?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you have the occasion.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your first name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.\" She snuggled into a chair that looked hard and almost ceramic in texture, but it slowly gave as she sat until it embraced her gently."},{"id":1016,"text":"Baley said, \"To business, now.\"\r\n\r\nShe said, \"To business.\"\r\n\r\nBaley found ft all extraordinarily difficult."},{"id":1017,"text":"There was no way even to make a beginning."},{"id":1018,"text":"On Earth he would ask name, rating, City and Sector of dwelling, a million different routine questions."},{"id":1019,"text":"He might even know the answers to begin with, yet it would be a device to ease into the serious phase."},{"id":1020,"text":"It would serve to introduce him to the person, make his judgment of the tactics to pursue something other than a mere guess."},{"id":1021,"text":"But here?"},{"id":1022,"text":"How could he be certain of anything?"},{"id":1023,"text":"The very verb \"to see\" meant different things to himself and to the woman."},{"id":1024,"text":"How many other words would be different?"},{"id":1025,"text":"How often would they be at cross-purposes without his being aware of it?"},{"id":1026,"text":"He said, \"How long were you married, Gladia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten years, Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\"How old are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-three.\"\r\n\r\nBaley felt obscurely pleased."},{"id":1027,"text":"She might easily have been a hundred thirty-three."},{"id":1028,"text":"He said, \"Were you happily married?\"\r\n\r\nGladia looked uneasy. \"How do you mean that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well-\" For a moment Baley was at a loss."},{"id":1029,"text":"How do you define a happy marriage."},{"id":1030,"text":"For that matter, what would a Solarian consider a happy marriage?"},{"id":1031,"text":"He said, \"Well, you saw one another often?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?"},{"id":1032,"text":"I should hope not."},{"id":1033,"text":"We're not animals, you know.\"\r\n\r\nBaley winced. \"You did live in the same mansion?"},{"id":1034,"text":"I thought-\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, we did."},{"id":1035,"text":"We were married."},{"id":1036,"text":"But I had my quarters and he had his."},{"id":1037,"text":"He had a very important career which took much of his time and I have my own work."},{"id":1038,"text":"We viewed each other whenever necessary.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw you, didn t he?\r\n\r\n\"It's not a thing one talks about but he did see me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you have any children?\"\r\n\r\nGladia jumped to her feet in obvious agitation. \"That's too much."},{"id":1039,"text":"Of all the indecent--\"\r\n\r\n\"Now wait."},{"id":1040,"text":"Wait!\" Baley brought his fist down on the arm of his chair. \"Don't be difficult."},{"id":1041,"text":"This is a murder investigation."},{"id":1042,"text":"Do you understand?"},{"id":1043,"text":"Murder."},{"id":1044,"text":"And it was your husband who was murdered."},{"id":1045,"text":"Do you want to see the murderer found and punished or don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then ask about the murder, not about-about-\"\r\n\r\n\"I have to ask all sorts of things."},{"id":1046,"text":"For one thing I want to know\r\n\r\nwhether you're sorry your husband is dead.\" He added with calculated brutality, \"You don't seem to be.\"\r\n\r\nShe stared at him haughtily. \"I'm sorry when anyone dies, especially when he's young and useful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't the fact that he was your husband make it just a little more than that?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was assigned to me and, well, we did see each other when scheduled and-and\"-she hurried the next words-\"and, if you must know, we don't have children because none have been assigned us yet."},{"id":1047,"text":"I don't see what all that has to do with being sorry over someone being dead.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe it had nothing to do with it, Baley thought."},{"id":1048,"text":"It depended on the social facts of life and with those he was not acquainted."},{"id":1049,"text":"He changed the subject. \"I'm told you have personal knowledge of the circumstances of the murder.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment she seemed to grow taut. \"I-discovered the body."},{"id":1050,"text":"Is that the way I should say it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you didn't witness the actual murder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no,\" she said faintly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, suppose you tell me what happened."},{"id":1051,"text":"Take your time and use your own words.\" He sat back and composed himself to listen."},{"id":1052,"text":"She began, \"It was on three-two of the fifth--\"\r\n\r\n\"When was that in Standard Time?\" asked Baley quickly.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure."},{"id":1053,"text":"I really don't know."},{"id":1054,"text":"You can check, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice seemed shaky and her eyes had grown large."},{"id":1055,"text":"They were a little too gray to be called blue, he noted."},{"id":1056,"text":"She said, \"He came to my quarters."},{"id":1057,"text":"It was our assigned day for seeing and I knew he'd come.\"\r\n\r\n\"He always came on the assigned day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes."},{"id":1058,"text":"He was a very conscientious man, a good Solarian."},{"id":1059,"text":"He never skipped an assigned day and always came at the same time."},{"id":1060,"text":"Of course, he didn't stay long."},{"id":1061,"text":"We have not been assigned ch-\"\r\n\r\nShe couldn't finish the word, but Baley nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Anyway,\" she said, \"he always came at the same time, you know, so that everything would be comfortable."},{"id":1062,"text":"We spoke a few minutes; seeing is an ordeal, but he always spoke quite normally to me."},{"id":1063,"text":"It was his way."},{"id":1064,"text":"Then he left to attend to some project he was involved with; I'm not sure what."},{"id":1065,"text":"He had a special laboratory in my quarters\r\n\r\nto which he could retire on seeing days."},{"id":1066,"text":"He had a much bigger one in his quarters, of course.\"\r\n\r\nBaley wondered what he did in those laboratories."},{"id":1067,"text":"Fetology, perhaps, whatever that was."},{"id":1068,"text":"He said, \"Did he seem unnatural in any way?"},{"id":1069,"text":"Worried?\"\r\n\r\n\"No."},{"id":1070,"text":"No."},{"id":1071,"text":"He was never worried.\" She came to the edge of a small laugh and buried it at the last moment. \"He always had perfect control, like your friend there.\" For a brief moment her small hand reached out and indicated Daneel, who did not stir.\r\n\r\n\"I see."},{"id":1072,"text":"Well, go on.\"\r\n\r\nGladia didn't."},{"id":1073,"text":"Instead she whispered, \"Do you mind if I have myself a drink?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please do.\"\r\n\r\nGladia's hand slipped along the arm of her chair momentarily."},{"id":1074,"text":"In less than a minute, a robot moved in silently and a warm drink (Baley could see the steam) was in her hand."},{"id":1075,"text":"She sipped slowly, then set the drink down."},{"id":1076,"text":"She said, \"That's better."},{"id":1077,"text":"May I ask a personal question?\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"You may always ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've read a lot about Earth."},{"id":1078,"text":"I've always been interested, you know."},{"id":1079,"text":"It's such a queer world.\" She gasped and added immediately, \"I didn't mean that.\"\r\n\r\nBaley frowned a little. \"Any world is queer to people who don't live on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean it's different."},{"id":1080,"text":"You know."},{"id":1081,"text":"Anyway, I want to ask a rude question."},{"id":1082,"text":"At least, I hope it doesn't seem rude to an Earthman."},{"id":1083,"text":"I wouldn't ask it of a Solarian, of course."},{"id":1084,"text":"Not for anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask what, Gladia?\"\r\n\r\n\"About you and your friend-Mr."},{"id":1085,"text":"Olivaw, is it?\" \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You two aren't viewing, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean each other."},{"id":1086,"text":"You're seeing."},{"id":1087,"text":"You're there, both of you.\" Baley said, \"We're physically together."},{"id":1088,"text":"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could touch him, if you wanted to.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked from one to the other and said, \"Oh.\"\r\n\r\nIt might have meant anything."},{"id":1089,"text":"Disgust?"},{"id":1090,"text":"Revulsion?"},{"id":1091,"text":"Baley toyed with the idea of standing up, walking to Daneel and\r\n\r\nplacing his hand flat on Daneel's face."},{"id":1092,"text":"It might be interesting to watch her reaction."},{"id":1093,"text":"He said, \"You were about to go' on with the events of that day when your husband came to see you.\" He was morally certain that her digression, however interesting it might have been intrinsically to her, was primarily motivated by a desire to avoid just that."},{"id":1094,"text":"She returned to her drink for a moment."},{"id":1095,"text":"Then: \"There isn't much to tell."},{"id":1096,"text":"I saw he would be engaged, and I knew he would be, anyway, because he was always at some sort of constructive work, so I went back to my own work."},{"id":1097,"text":"Then, perhaps fifteen minutes later, I heard a shout.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause and Baley prodded her. \"What kind of a shout?\"\r\n\r\nShe said, \"Rikaine's."},{"id":1098,"text":"My husband's."},{"id":1099,"text":"Just a shout."},{"id":1100,"text":"No words."},{"id":1101,"text":"A ldnd of fright."},{"id":1102,"text":"No!"},{"id":1103,"text":"Surprise, shock."},{"id":1104,"text":"Something like that."},{"id":1105,"text":"I'd never heard him shout before.\"\r\n\r\nShe lifted her hands to her ears as though to shut out even the memory of the sound and her wrapper slipped slowly down to her waist."},{"id":1106,"text":"She took no notice and Baley stared firmly at his notebook."},{"id":1107,"text":"He said, \"What did you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I ran."},{"id":1108,"text":"I ran."},{"id":1109,"text":"I didn't know where he was-\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you said he had gone to the laboratory he maintained in your quarters.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did, E-Elijah, but I didn't know where that was."},{"id":1110,"text":"Not for sure, anyway."},{"id":1111,"text":"I never went there."},{"id":1112,"text":"It was his."},{"id":1113,"text":"I had a general idea of its direction."},{"id":1114,"text":"I knew it was somewhere in the west, but I was so upset, I didn't even think to summon any robot."},{"id":1115,"text":"One of them would have guided me easily, but of course none came without being summoned."},{"id":1116,"text":"When I did get there-I found it somehow-he was dead.\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped suddenly and, to Baley's acute discomfort, she bent her head and wept."},{"id":1117,"text":"She made no attempt to obscure her face."},{"id":1118,"text":"Her eyes simply closed and tears slowly trickled down her cheeks."},{"id":1119,"text":"It was quite soundless."},{"id":1120,"text":"Her shoulders barely trembled."},{"id":1121,"text":"Then her eyes opened and looked at him through swimming tears. \"I never saw a dead man before."},{"id":1122,"text":"He was all bloody and his head was-just-all- I managed to get a robot and he called others and I suppose they took care of me and of Rikaine."},{"id":1123,"text":"I don't remember."},{"id":1124,"text":"I don't--\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"What do you mean, they took care of Rikaine?\"\r\n\r\n\"They took him away and cleaned up.\" There was a small wedge of indignation in her voice, the lady of the house careful of its condition. \"Things were a mess.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what happened to the body?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"I don't know."},{"id":1125,"text":"Burned, I suppose."},{"id":1126,"text":"Like any dead body.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't call the police?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him blankly and Baley thought: No police!"},{"id":1127,"text":"He said, \"You told somebody, I suppose."},{"id":1128,"text":"People found out about the matter.\"\r\n\r\nShe said, \"The robots called a doctor."},{"id":1129,"text":"And I had to call Rikaine's place of work."},{"id":1130,"text":"The robots there had to know he wouldn't be back.\"\r\n\r\n\"The doctor was for you, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded."},{"id":1131,"text":"For the first time, she seemed to notice her wrapper draped about her hips."},{"id":1132,"text":"She pulled it up into position, murmuring forlornly, \"I'm sorry."},{"id":1133,"text":"I'm sorry.\"\r\n\r\nBaley felt uncomfortable, watching her as she sat there helpless, shivering, her face contorted with the absolute terror that had come over her with the memory."},{"id":1134,"text":"She had never seen a dead body before."},{"id":1135,"text":"She had never seen blood and a crushed skull."},{"id":1136,"text":"And if the husband-wife relationship on Solaria was something thin and shallow, it was still a dead human being with whom she had been confronted."},{"id":1137,"text":"Baley scarcely knew what to say or do next."},{"id":1138,"text":"He had the impulse to apologize, and yet, as a policeman, he was doing only his duty."},{"id":1139,"text":"But there were no police on this world."},{"id":1140,"text":"Would she understand that this was his duty?"},{"id":1141,"text":"Slowly, and as gently as he could, he said, \"Gladia, did you hear anything at all?"},{"id":1142,"text":"Anything besides your husband's shout.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up, her face as pretty as ever, despite its obvious distress-perhaps because of it."},{"id":1143,"text":"She said, \"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"No running footsteps?"},{"id":1144,"text":"No other voice?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"I didn't hear anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you found your husband, he was completely alone?"},{"id":1145,"text":"You two

any.\"\r\n\r\n\"If anything like that had been there, I imagine you would have seen it."},{"id":1165,"text":"It follows then that a hand held something capable of crushing a man's skull and that hand swung it."},{"id":1166,"text":"Some person had to be within four feet of your husband to do that."},{"id":1167,"text":"So someone did see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one would,\" she said earnestly. \"A

had caused him to forget."},{"id":1196,"text":"It was Daneel who annoyed him, he thought, with his unemotional ap\r\n\r\nproach to problems."},{"id":1197,"text":"Or perhaps it was himself, with his emotional approach."},{"id":1198,"text":"He did not stop to analyze the matter."},{"id":1199,"text":"He said, \"That will be all for now, Glaclia."},{"id":1200,"text":"However one goes about it, break

hypothetical.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" was the calm reply. \"You will have noticed, I think, that she concentrated her attention entirely on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was doing the talking,\" said

suppose that she discovered one weakness Earthmen possess."},{"id":1226,"text":"She must know of the nudity tabu, and of how such a display must impress an Earthman.\"\r\n\r\n\"She-she explained about

robot involved."},{"id":1343,"text":"A robot was at the scene.\"\r\n\r\nDaneel interposed for the first time. \"The robot was not at the scene."},{"id":1344,"text":"Had it been there, the crime would not have been committed.\"\r\n\r\nBaley turned his head sharply."},{"id":1345,"text":"And Cruer, ,who had lifted his glass a second time as though about to drink, put it down again to stare at Daneel.\r\n\r\n\"Is that not so?\" asked Daneel.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so,\" said Gruer. \"A robot would have stopped one person from harming another."},{"id":1346,"text":"First Law.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Baley. \"Granted."},{"id":1347,"text":"But it must have been close."},{"id":1348,"text":"It was on the scene when the other robots arrived."},{"id":1349,"text":"Say it was in the next room."},{"id":1350,"text":"The murderer is advancing on Delmarre and Delmarre cries out, 'You're going to kill me.'

I agree with your reconstruction that far."},{"id":1360,"text":"They were probably Delmarre's last words burned into the robot's consciousness when everything else was destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm told Solaria specializes in robots."},{"id":1361,"text":"Was there no way in which the robot could be repaired?"},{"id":1362,"text":"No way in which its circuits could be patched?\"\r\n\r\n\"None,\" said Gruer sharply.\r\n\r\n\"And where is the robot, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Scrapped,\" said Gruer."},{"id":1363,"text":"Baley raised his eyebrows. \"This is a rather peculiar case."},{"id":1364,"text":"No motive, no means, no witnesses, no evidence."},{"id":1365,"text":"Where there was some evidence to begin with, it was destroyed."},{"id":1366,"text":"You have only one suspect and everyone seems convinced of her guilt; at least, everyone is certain no one else can be guilty.' That's your opinion, too, obviously."},{"id":1367,"text":"The question then is: Why was I sent for?\"\r\n\r\nGruer frowned. \"You seem upset, Mr."},{"id":1368,"text":"Baley.\" He turned abruptly to Daneel. \"Mr."},{"id":1369,"text":"Olivaw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Agent Gruer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't you please go through the dwelling and make sure all windows are closed and blanked out?"},{"id":1370,"text":"Plainclothesman Baley may be feeling the effects of open space.\"\r\n\r\nThe statement astonished Baley."},{"id":1371,"text":"It was his impulse to deny Gruer's assumption and order Daneel to keep his place when, on the brink, he caught something of panic in Gruer's voice, something of glittering appeal in his eyes."},{"id":1372,"text":"He sat back and let Daneel leave the room."},{"id":1373,"text":"It was as though a mask had dropped from Gruer's face, leaving it naked and afraid."},{"id":1374,"text":"Gruer said, \"That was easier than I had thought."},{"id":1375,"text":"I'd planned so many ways of getting you alone."},{"id":1376,"text":"I never thought the Auroran would leave at a simple request, and yet I could think of nothing else to do.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"Well, I'm alone now.\"\r\n\r\nGruer said, \"I couldn't speak freely in his presence."},{"id":1377,"text":"He's an Auroran and he is here because he was forced on us as the price of having you.\" The Solarian leaned forward. \"There's something more\r\n\r\nto this than murder."},{"id":1378,"text":"I am not concerned only with the matter of who did it."},{"id":1379,"text":"There are parties on Solaria, secret organizations. . . .\"\r\n\r\nBaley stared. \"Surely, I can't help you there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you can."},{"id":1380,"text":"Now understand this: Dr."},{"id":1381,"text":"Delmarre was a Traditionalist."},{"id":1382,"text":"He believed in the old ways, the good ways."},{"id":1383,"text":"But there are new forces among us, forces

matter."},{"id":1386,"text":"There is an organization behind her and that is the important matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure?"},{"id":1387,"text":"Do you have evidence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vague evidence, only."},{"id":1388,"text":"I can't help that."},{"id":1389,"text":"Rikaine Delmarre was on the track of something."},{"id":1390,"text":"He assured me his evidence was good, and I believe him."},{"id":1391,"text":"I knew him well enough to know him as neither fool nor child."},{"id":1392,"text":"Unfortunately, he told me very little."},{"id":1393,"text":"Naturally, he wanted to complete his investigation before laying the matter completely open to the authorities."},{"id":1394,"text":"He must have gotten close to completion, too, or they wouldn't have dared the risk of having him openly slaughtered by violence."},{"id":1395,"text":"One thing Delmarre told me, though."},{"id":1396,"text":"The whole human race is in danger.\"\r\n\r\nBaley felt himself shaken."},{"id":1397,"text":"For a moment it was as though he were listening to Minnim again, but on an even larger scale."},{"id":1398,"text":"Was everyone going to turn to him with cosmic dangers?\r\n\r\n\"Why do you think I can help?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Because you're an Earthman,\" said Gruer. \"Do you understand?"},{"id":1399,"text":"We on Solaria have no experience with these things."},{"id":1400,"text":"In a way, we don't understand people."},{"id":1401,"text":"There are too few of us here.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked uneasy. \"I don't like to say this, Mr."},{"id":1402,"text":"Baley."},{"id":1403,"text":"My colleagues laugh at me and some grow angry, but it is a definite feeling I have."},{"id":1404,"text":"It seems to me that you Earthmen must understand people far better than we do, just by living among such crowds of them."},{"id":1405,"text":"And a detective more than anyone."},{"id":1406,"text":"Isn't that so?\"\r\n\r\nBaley half nodded and held his tongue."},{"id":1407,"text":"Gruer said, \"In a way, this murder was fortunate."},{"id":1408,"text":"I have not dared speak to the others about Delmarre's investigation, since I wasn't sure who might be involved in the conspiracy, and Delmarre himself was not ready to give any details till his investigation was complete."},{"id":1409,"text":"And even if Delmarre had completed his work, how would we deal with the matter afterward?"},{"id":1410,"text":"How does one deal with hostile human\r\n\r\nbeings?"},{"id":1411,"text":"I don't know."},{"id":1412,"text":"From the beginning, I felt we needed an Earthman."},{"id":1413,"text":"When I heard of your work in connection with the murder in Spacetown on Earth, I knew we needed you."},{"id":1414,"text":"I got in touch with Aurora, with whose men you had worked most closely, and through them approached the Earth government."},{"id":1415,"text":"Yet my own colleagues could not be persuaded into agreeing to this."},{"id":1416,"text":"Then came the murder and that was enough of a shock to give me the agreement I needed."},{"id":1417,"text":"At the moment, they would have agreed to anything.\"\r\n\r\nGruer hesitated, then added, \"It's not easy to ask an Earthman to help, but I must do so."},{"id":1418,"text":"Remember, whatever it is, the human race is in danger."},{"id":1419,"text":"Earth, too.\"\r\n\r\nEarth was doubly in danger, then."},{"id":1420,"text":"There was no mistaking the desperate sincerity in Gruer's voice."},{"id":1421,"text":"But then, if the murder were so fortunate a pretext for allowing Gruer to do what he so desperately wanted to do all the time, was it entirely fortune?"},{"id":1422,"text":"It opened new avenues of thought that were not reflected in Baley's face, eyes, or voice."},{"id":1423,"text":"Baley said, \"I have been sent here, sir, to help."},{"id":1424,"text":"I will do so to the best of my ability.\"\r\n\r\nGruer finally lifted his long-delayed drink and looked over the rim of the glass at Baley. \"Good,\" he said. \"Not a word to the Auroran, please."},{"id":1425,"text":"Whatever this is about, Aurora may be involved."},{"id":1426,"text":"Certainly they took an unusually intense interest in the case."},{"id":1427,"text":"For instance, they insisted on including Mr."},{"id":1428,"text":"Olivaw as your partner."},{"id":1429,"text":"Aurora is powerful; we had to agree."},{"id":1430,"text":"They say they include Mr."},{"id":1431,"text":"Olivaw only because he worked with you before, but it may well be that they wish a reliable man of their own on the scene, eh?\"\r\n\r\nHe sipped slowly, his eyes on Baley."},{"id":1432,"text":"Baley passed the knuckles of one hand against his long cheek, rubbing it thoughtfully. \"Now if that-\"\r\n\r\nHe didn't finish, but leaped from his chair and almost hurled himself toward the other, before remembering it was only an image he was facing."},{"id":1433,"text":"For Gruer, staring wildly at his drink, clutched his throat, whispering hoarsely, \"Burning. . ."},{"id":1434,"text":"burning. . .\"\r\n\r\nThe glass fell from his hand, its contents spilling."},{"id":1435,"text":"And Gruer dropped with it, his face distorted with pain."},{"id":1436,"text":"DArEnL STOOD in the doorway. 'What happened, Partner Eli-\"\r\n\r\nBut no explanation was needed."},{"id":1437,"text":"Daneel's voice changed to a loud ringing shout. \"Robots of Hannis Gruer!"},{"id":1438,"text":"Your master is hurt!"},{"id":1439,"text":"Robots!\"\r\n\r\nAt once a metal figure strode into the dining room and after it, in a minute or two, a dozen more entered."},{"id":1440,"text":"Three carried Gruer gently away."},{"id":1441,"text":"The others busily engaged in straightening the disarray and picking up the tableware strewn on the floor."},{"id":1442,"text":"Daneel called out suddenly, \"You there, robots, never mind the crockery."},{"id":1443,"text":"Organize a search."},{"id":1444,"text":"Search the house for any human being."},{"id":1445,"text":"Alert any robots on the grounds outside."},{"id":1446,"text":"Have them go over every acre of the estate."},{"id":1447,"text":"If you find a master, hold him."},{"id":1448,"text":"Do not hurt him\" (unnecessary advice) \"but do not let him leave, either."},{"id":1449,"text":"If you find no master present, let me know."},{"id":1450,"text":"I will remain at this viewer combination.\"\r\n\r\nThen, as robots scattered, Elijah muttered to Daneel, \"That's a beginning."},{"id":1451,"text":"It was poison, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes."},{"id":1452,"text":"That much is obvious, Partner Elijah.\" Daneel sat down queerly, as though there were a weakness in his knees."},{"id":1453,"text":"Baley had never seen him give way so, not for an instant, to any action that resembled anything so human as a weakness in the knees."},{"id":1454,"text":"Daneel said, \"It is not well with my mechanism to see a human being come to harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was nothing you could do.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I understand and yet it is as though there were certain\r\n\r\ncloggings in my thought paths."},{"id":1455,"text":"In human terms what I feel might be the equivalent to shock.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that's so, get over it.\" Baley felt neither patience nor sympathy for a queasy robot. \"We've got to consider the little matter of responsibility."},{"id":1456,"text":"There is no poison without a poisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might have been food-poisoning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Accidental food-poisoning?"},{"id":1457,"text":"On a world this neatly run?"},{"id":1458,"text":"Never."},{"id":1459,"text":"Besides, the poison was in a liquid and the symptoms were sudden and complete."},{"id":1460,"text":"It was a poisoned dose and a large one."},{"id":1461,"text":"Look, Daneel, I'll go into the next room to think this out a bit."},{"id":1462,"text":"You get Mrs."},{"id":1463,"text":"Delmarre."},{"id":1464,"text":"Make sure she's at home and check the distance between her estate and Gruer's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it that you think she--\"\r\n\r\nBaley held up a hand. \"Just find out, will you?\"\r\n\r\nHe strode out of the room, seeking solitude."},{"id":1465,"text":"Surely there could not be two independent attempts at murder so close together in time on a world like Solaria."},{"id":1466,"text":"And if a connection existed, the easiest assumption to make was that Gruer's story of a conspiracy was true."},{"id":1467,"text":"Baley felt a familiar excitement growing within him."},{"id":1468,"text":"He had come to this world with Earth's predicament in his mind, and his own."},{"id":1469,"text":"The murder itself had been a faraway thing, but now the chase was really on."},{"id":1470,"text":"The muscles in his jaw knotted."},{"id":1471,"text":"After all, the murderer or murderers (or murderess) had struck in his presence and he was stung by that."},{"id":1472,"text":"Was he held in so little account?"},{"id":1473,"text":"It was professional pride that was hurt and Baley knew it and welcomed the fact."},{"id":1474,"text":"At least it gave him a firm reason to see this thing through as a murder case, simply, even without reference to Earth's dangers."},{"id":1475,"text":"Daneel had located him now and was striding toward him. \"I have done as you asked me to, Partner Elijah."},{"id":1476,"text":"I have viewed Mrs."},{"id":1477,"text":"Delmarre."},{"id":1478,"text":"She is at her home, which is somewhat over a thousand miles from the estate of Agent Gruer.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"I'll see her myself later."},{"id":1479,"text":"View her, I mean.\" He stared thoughtfully at Daneel. \"Do you think she has any connection with this crime?\"\r\n\r\n\"Apparently not a direct connection, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does that imply there might be an indirect connection?\"\r\n\r\n\"She might have persuaded someone else to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Someone else?\" Baley asked quickly. \"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"That, Partner Elijah, I cannot say.\"\r\n\r\n\"If someone were acting for her, that someone .would have to be at the scene of the crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Daneel, \"someone must have been there to place the poison in the liquid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it possible that the poisoned liquid might have been prepared earlier in the day?"},{"id":1480,"text":"Perhaps much earlier?\"\r\n\r\nDaneel said quietly, \"I had thought of that, Partner Elijah, which is why I used the word 'apparently' when I stated that Mrs."},{"id":1481,"text":"Delmarre had no direct connection with the crime."},{"id":1482,"text":"It is within the realm of possibility for her to have been on the scene earlier in the day."},{"id":1483,"text":"It would be well to check her movements.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will do that."},{"id":1484,"text":"We will check whether she was physically present at any time.\"\r\n\r\nBaley's lips twitched."},{"id":1485,"text":"He had guessed that in some ways robotic logic must fall short and he was convinced of it now."},{"id":1486,"text":"As the roboticist had said: Logical but not reasonable."},{"id":1487,"text":"He said, \"Let's get back into the viewing room and get Gruer's estate back in view.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe room sparkled with freshness and order."},{"id":1488,"text":"There was no sign at all that less than an hour before a man had collapsed in agony."},{"id":1489,"text":"Three robots stood, backs against the wall, in the usual robotic attitude of respectful submission."},{"id":1490,"text":"Baley said, \"What news concerning your master?\"\r\n\r\nThe middle robot said, \"The doctor is attending him, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Viewing or seeing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Viewing, master.\"\r\n\r\n'What does the doctor say?"},{"id":1491,"text":"Will your master live?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not yet certain, master.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"Has the house been searched?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thoroughly, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was there any sign of another master beside your own?\" \"No, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"'VVere there any signs of such presence in the near past?\" \"Not at all, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are the grounds being searched?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any results so far?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, master.\"\r\n\r\nBaley nodded and said, \"I wish to speak to the robot that served at the table this night.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is being held for inspection, master."},{"id":1492,"text":"Its reactions are erratic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can it speak?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then get it here without delay.\"\r\n\r\nThere was delay and Baley began again. \"I said-\"\r\n\r\nDaneel interrupted smoothly. \"There is interradio communication among these Solarian types."},{"id":1493,"text":"The robot you desire is being summoned."},{"id":1494,"text":"If it is slow in coming, it is part of the disturbance that has overtaken it as the result of what has occurred.\"\r\n\r\nBaley nodded."},{"id":1495,"text":"He might have guessed at interradio."},{"id":1496,"text":"In a world so thoroughly given over to robots some sort of intimate communication among them would be necessary if the system were not to break down."},{"id":1497,"text":"It explained how a dozen robots could follow when one robot had been summoned, but only when needed and not otherwise."},{"id":1498,"text":"A robot entered."},{"id":1499,"text":"It limped, one leg dragging."},{"id":1500,"text":"Baley wondered why and then shrugged."},{"id":1501,"text":"Even among the primitive robots on Earth reactions to injury of the positronic paths were never obvious to the layman."},{"id":1502,"text":"A disrupted circuit might strike a leg's functioning, as here, and the fact would be most significant to a roboticist and completely meaningless to anyone else."},{"id":1503,"text":"Baley said cautiously, \"Do you remember a colorless liquid on your master's table, some of which you poured into a goblet for him?\"\r\n\r\nThe robot said, \"Yeth, mathter.\" A defect in oral articulation, too!"},{"id":1504,"text":"Baley said, \"What was the nature of the liquid?\" \"It wath water, mathter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just water?"},{"id":1505,"text":"Nothing else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jutht water, mathter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get it?\"\r\n\r\n\"From the rethervoir tap, mathter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had it been standing in the kitchen before you brought it in?\"\r\n\r\n\"The mathter preferred it not too cold, mathter."},{"id":1506,"text":"It wath a thtanding order that it be poured an hour before mealth.\"\r\n\r\nHow convenient, thought Baley, for anyone who knew that fact."},{"id":1507,"text":"He said, \"Have one of the robots connect me with the doctor viewing your master as soon as he is available."},{"id":1508,"text":"And while that is being\r\n\r\ndone, I want another one to explain how the reservoir tap works."},{"id":1509,"text":"I want to know about the water supply here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctor was available with little delay."},{"id":1510,"text":"He was the oldest Spacer Baley had ever seen, which meant, Baley thought, that he might be over three hundred years old."},{"id":1511,"text":"The veins stood out on his hands and his close-cropped hair was pure white."},{"id":1512,"text":"He had a habit of tapping his ridged front teeth with a fingernail, making a little clicking noise that Baley found annoying."},{"id":1513,"text":"His name was Altim Thool."},{"id":1514,"text":"The doctor said, \"Fortunately, he threw up a good deal of the dose."},{"id":1515,"text":"Still, he may not survive."},{"id":1516,"text":"It is a tragic event.\" He sighed heavily.\r\n\r\n\"What was the poison, Doctor?\" asked Baley.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I don't know.\" (Click-click-click.)\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"What?"},{"id":1517,"text":"Then how are you treating him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Direct stimulation of the neuromuscular system to prevent paralysis, but except for that I am letting nature take its course.\" His face, with its faintly yellow skin, like well-worn leather of superior quality, wore a pleading expression. \"We have very little experience with this sort of thing."},{"id":1518,"text":"I don't recall another case in over two centuries of practice.\"\r\n\r\nBaley stared at the other with contempt. \"You know there are such things as poisons, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes.\" (Click-click.) \"Common knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have book-film references where you can gain some knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would take days."},{"id":1519,"text":"There are numerous mineral poisons."},{"id":1520,"text":"We make use of insecticides in our society, and it is not impossible to obtain bacterial toxins."},{"id":1521,"text":"Even with descriptions in the films it would take a long time to gather the equipment and develop the techniques to test for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"If no one on Solaria knows,\" said Baley grimly, \"I'd suggest you get in touch with one of the other worlds and find out."},{"id":1522,"text":"Meanwhile, you had better test the reservoir tap in Gruer's mansion for poison."},{"id":1523,"text":"Get there in person, if you have to, and do it.\"\r\n\r\nBaley was prodding a venerable Spacer roughly, ordering him about like a robot and was quite unconscious of the incongruity of it."},{"id":1524,"text":"Nor did the Spacer make any protest."},{"id":1525,"text":"Dr."},{"id":1526,"text":"Thool said doubtfully, \"How could the reservoir tap be poisoned?"},{"id":1527,"text":"I'm sure it couldn't be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably not,\" agreed Baley, \"but test it anyway to make sure.\" The reservoir tap was a dim possibility indeed."},{"id":1528,"text":"The robot's explanation had shown it to be a typical piece of Solarian self-care."},{"id":1529,"text":"Water might enter it from whatever source and be tailored to suit."},{"id":1530,"text":"Microorganisms were removed and non-living organic matter eliminated."},{"id":1531,"text":"The proper amount of aeration was introduced, as were various ions in just those trace amounts best suited to the body's needs."},{"id":1532,"text":"It was very unlikely that any poison could survive one or another of the control devices."},{"id":1533,"text":"Still, if the safety of the reservoir were directly established, then the time element would be clear."},{"id":1534,"text":"There would be the matter of the hour before the meal, when the pitcher of water (exposed to air, thought Baley sourly) was allowed to warm slowly, thanks to Gruer's idiosyncrasy."},{"id":1535,"text":"But Dr."},{"id":1536,"text":"Thool, frowning, was saying, \"But how would I test the reservoir tap?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jehoshaphat!"},{"id":1537,"text":"Take an animal with you."},{"id":1538,"text":"Inject some of the water you take out of the tap into its veins, or have it drink some."},{"id":1539,"text":"Use your head, man."},{"id":1540,"text":"And do the same for what's left in the pitcher, and if that's poisoned, as it must be, run some of the tests the reference films describe."},{"id":1541,"text":"Find some simple ones."},{"id":1542,"text":"Do something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, wait."},{"id":1543,"text":"What pitcher?\"\r\n\r\n\"The pitcher in which the water was standing."},{"id":1544,"text":"The pitcher from which the robot poured the poisoned

Daneel ask for an explanation."},{"id":1557,"text":"Such an invasion of a human's thoughts would have been most unrobotic."},{"id":1558,"text":"Baley prowled back and forth restlessly, dreading the approach of the sleep period, when his fears of the open would rise and his longing for Earth increase."},{"id":1559,"text":"He felt an almost feverish desire to keep things happening."},{"id":1560,"text":"He said to Daneel, \"I might as well see Mrs."},{"id":1561,"text":"Delmarre again."},{"id":1562,"text":"Have the robot make contact.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked to the viewing room and Baley watched a robot work with deft metal fingers."},{"id":1563,"text":"He watched through a haze of obscuring thought that vanished in startled astonishment when a table, elaborately spread for dinner, suddenly filled half the room."},{"id":1564,"text":"Gladia's voice said, \"Hello.\" A moment later she stepped into view and sat down. \"Don't look surprised, Elijah."},{"id":1565,"text":"It's just dinnertime."},{"id":1566,"text":"And I'm very carefully dressed."},{"id":1567,"text":"See?\"\r\n\r\nShe was."},{"id":1568,"text":"The dominant color of her dress was a light blue and it shimmered down the length of her limbs to wrists and anldes."},{"id":1569,"text":"A yellow ruff clung about her neck and shoulders, a little lighter than her hair, which was now held in disciplined waves."},{"id":1570,"text":"Baley said, \"I did not mean to interrupt your meal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't begun yet."},{"id":1571,"text":"Why don't you join me?\"\r\n\r\nHe eyed her suspiciously. \"Join you?\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. \"You Earthmen are so funny."},{"id":1572,"text":"I don't mean join me in personal presence."},{"id":1573,"text":"How could you do that?"},{"id":1574,"text":"I mean, go to your own dining room and then you and the other one can dine with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if I leave--\"\r\n\r\n\"Your viewing technician can maintain contact.\"\r\n\r\nDaneel nodded gravely at that, and with some uncertainty Baley turned and walked toward the door."},{"id":1575,"text":"Gladia, together with her table, its setting, and its ornaments moved with him."},{"id":1576,"text":"Gladia smiled encouragingly. \"See?"},{"id":1577,"text":"Your viewing technician is keeping us in contact.\"\r\n\r\nBaley and Daneel traveled up a moving ramp that Baley did not recall having traversed before."},{"id":1578,"text":"Apparently there were numerous possible routes between any two rooms in this impossible mansion and he knew oniy few of them."},{"id":1579,"text":"Daneel, of course, knew them all."},{"id":1580,"text":"And, moving through walls, sometimes a bit below floor level, sometimes a bit above, there was always Gladia and her dinner table."},{"id":1581,"text":"Baley stopped and muttered, \"This takes getting used to.\"\r\n\r\nGladia said at once, \"Does it make you dizzy?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I tell you what."},{"id":1582,"text":"Why don't you have your technicians freeze me right here."},{"id":1583,"text":"Then when you're in your dining room and all set, he can join us up.\"\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"I will order that done, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir own dinner table was set when they arrived, the plates steaming with a dark brown soup in which diced meat was bobbing, and in the center a large roast fowl was ready for the carving."},{"id":1584,"text":"Daneel spoke briefly to the serving robot and, with smooth efficiency, the two places that had been set were drawn to the same end of the table."},{"id":1585,"text":"As though that were a signal, the opposite wall seemed to move outward, the table seemed to lengthen and Gladia was seated at the opposite end."},{"id":1586,"text":"Room joined to room and table to table so neatly that but for the varying pattern in wall and floor covering and the differing designs in tableware it would have been easy to believe they were all dining together in actual fact.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said Gladia with satisfaction. \"Isn't this comfortable?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite,\" said Baley."},{"id":1587,"text":"He tasted his soup gingerly, found it delicious, and helped himself more generously. \"YOU know about Agent Gruer?\"\r\n\r\nTrouble shadowed her face at once and she put her spoon down. \"Isn't it terrible?"},{"id":1588,"text":"Poor Hannis.\"\r\n\r\n\"You use his first name."},{"id":1589,"text":"Do you know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know almost all the important people on Solaria."},{"id":1590,"text":"Most Solarians do know one another."},{"id":1591,"text":"Naturally.\"\r\n\r\nNaturally, indeed, thought Baley."},{"id":1592,"text":"How many of them were there, after all?"},{"id":1593,"text":"Baley said, \"Then perhaps you know Dr."},{"id":1594,"text":"Altim Thool."},{"id":1595,"text":"He's taking care of Gruer.\"\r\n\r\nGladia laughed gently."},{"id":1596,"text":"Her serving robot sliced meat for her and added small, browned potatoes and slivers of carrots. \"Of course I know him."},{"id":1597,"text":"He treated me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Treated you when?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right after the-the trouble."},{"id":1598,"text":"About my husband, I mean.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said in astonishment, \"Is he the only doct~r on the planet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no.\" For a moment her lips moved as though she were counting to herself. \"There are at least ten."},{"id":1599,"text":"And there's one youngster I know of who's studying medicine."},{"id":1600,"text":"But Dr."},{"id":1601,"text":"Thool is one of the best."},{"id":1602,"text":"He has the most experience."},{"id":1603,"text":"Poor Dr."},{"id":1604,"text":"Thool.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why poor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know what I mean."},{"id":1605,"text":"It's such a nasty job, being a doctor."},{"id":1606,"text":"Sometimes you just have to see people when you're a doctor and even touch them."},{"id":1607,"text":"But Dr."},{"id":1608,"text":"Thool seems so resigned to it and he'll always do some seeing when he feels he must."},{"id":1609,"text":"He's always treated me since I was a child and was always so friendly and kind and I honestly feel I almost wouldn't mind if he did have to see me."},{"id":1610,"text":"For instance, he saw me this last time.\"\r\n\r\n\"After your husband's death, you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes."},{"id":1611,"text":"You can imagine how he felt when he saw my husband's dead body and me lying there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was told he viewed the body,\" said Baley.\r\n\r\n\"The body, yes."},{"id":1612,"text":"But after he made sure I was alive and in no real danger, he ordered the robots to put a pillow under my head and give me an injection of something or other, and then get out."},{"id":1613,"text":"He came over by jet."},{"id":1614,"text":"Really!"},{"id":1615,"text":"By jet."},{"id":1616,"text":"It took less than half an hour and he took care of me and made sure all was well."},{"id":1617,"text":"I was so woozy when I came to that I was sure I was only viewing him, you know, and it wasn't till he touched me that I knew we were seeing, and I screamed."},{"id":1618,"text":"Poor Dr."},{"id":1619,"text":"Thool."},{"id":1620,"text":"He was awfully embarrassed, but I knew he meant well.\"\r\n\r\nBaley nodded. \"I suppose there's not much use for doctors on Solaria?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should hope not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know there are no germ diseases to speak of."},{"id":1621,"text":"What about metabolic disorders?"},{"id":1622,"text":"Atherosclerosis?"},{"id":1623,"text":"Diabetes?"},{"id":1624,"text":"Things like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It happens and it's pretty awful when it does."},{"id":1625,"text":"Doctors can make life more livable for such people in a physical way, but that's the least of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course."},{"id":1626,"text":"It means the gene analysis was imperfect."},{"id":1627,"text":"You don't suppose we allow defects like diabetes to develop on purpose."},{"id":1628,"text":"Anyone who develops such things has to undergo very detailed re\r\n\r\nanalysis."},{"id":1629,"text":"The mate assignment has to be retracted, which is terribly embarrassing for the mate."},{"id":1630,"text":"And it means no-no\"-her voice sank to a whisper-\"children.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said in a normal voice, \"No children?\"\r\n\r\nGladia flushed. \"It's a terrible thing to say."},{"id":1631,"text":"Such a word!"},{"id":1632,"text":"Chchildren!\"\r\n\r\n\"It comes easy after a while,\" said Baley dryly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but if I get into the habit, I'll say it in front of another Solarian someday and I'll just sink into the ground. . . ."},{"id":1633,"text":"Anyway, if the two of them have had children (see, I've said it again) already, the children have to be found and examined-that was one of Rikaine's jobs, by the way-and well, it's just a mess.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for Thool, thought Baley."},{"id":1634,"text":"The doctor's incompetence was a natural consequence of the society, and held nothing sinister."},{"id":1635,"text":"Nothing necessarily sinister."},{"id":1636,"text":"Cross him off, he thought, but lightly."},{"id":1637,"text":"He watched Gladia as she ate."},{"id":1638,"text":"She was neat and precisely delicate in her movements and her appetite seemed normal. (His own fowl was delightful."},{"id":1639,"text":"In one respect, anyway-food-he could easily be spoiled by these Outer Worlds.)\r\n\r\nHe said, 'What is your opinion of the poisoning, Gladia?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up. \"I'm trying not to think of it."},{"id":1640,"text":"There are so many horrors lately."},{"id":1641,"text":"Maybe it wasn't poisoning.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there wasn't anyone around?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"There couldn't have been."},{"id":1642,"text":"He has no wife, these days, since he's all through with his quota of ch-you know what."},{"id":1643,"text":"So there was no one to put the poison in anything, so how could he be poisoned?\"\r\n\r\n\"But he was poisoned."},{"id":1644,"text":"That's a fact and must be accepted.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes clouded over. \"Do you suppose,\" she said, \"he did it himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt it."},{"id":1645,"text":"Why should he?"},{"id":1646,"text":"And so publicly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it couldn't be done, Elijah."},{"id":1647,"text":"It just couldn't.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"On the contrary, Gladia."},{"id":1648,"text":"It could be done very easily."},{"id":1649,"text":"And I'm sure I know exactly how.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLADIA Seemed to be holding her breath for a moment."},{"id":1650,"text":"It came out through puckered lips in what was almost a whistle."},{"id":1651,"text":"She said, \"I'm sure I don't see how."},{"id":1652,"text":"Do you know who did it?\"\r\n\r\nBaley nodded. \"The same one who killed your husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you?"},{"id":1653,"text":"Your husband's murder was the first in the history of Solarja."},{"id":1654,"text":"A month later there is another murder."},{"id":1655,"text":"Could that be a coincidence?"},{"id":1656,"text":"Two separate murderers striking within a month of each other on a crime-free world?"},{"id":1657,"text":"Consider, too, that the second victim was investigating the first crime and therefore represented a violent danger to the original murderer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" Gladia applied herself to her dessert and said between mouthfuls, \"If you put it that way, I'm innocent.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so, Gladia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Elijah."},{"id":1658,"text":"I've never been near the Gruer estate, never in my whole life."},{"id":1659,"text":"So I certainly couldn't have poisoned Agent Gruer."},{"id":1660,"text":"And if I haven't-why, neither did I kill my husband.\"\r\n\r\nThen, as Baley maintained a stern silence, her spirit seemed to fade and the corners of her small mouth drooped. \"Don't you think so, Elijah?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't be sure,\" said Baley. \"I've told you I know the method used to poison Gruer."},{"id":1661,"text":"It's an ingenious one and anyone on Solaria could have used it, whether they were on the Gruer estate or not; whether they were ever on the Gruer estate or not.\"\r\n\r\nGladia clenched her hands into fists. \"Are you saying I did it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not saying that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're implying it.\" Her lips were thin with fury and her high cheekbones were splotchy. \"Is that all your interest in viewing me?"},{"id":1662,"text":"To ask me sly questions?"},{"id":1663,"text":"To trap me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now wait--\"\r\n\r\n\"You seemed so sympathetic."},{"id":1664,"text":"So understanding."},{"id":1665,"text":"You-you Earthman!\"\r\n\r\nHer contralto had become a tortured rasp with the last word."},{"id":1666,"text":"Daneel's perfect face leaned toward Gladia and he said, \"If you will pardon me, Mrs."},{"id":1667,"text":"Delmarre, you are holding a knife rather tightly and may cut yourself."},{"id":1668,"text":"Please be careful.\"\r\n\r\nGladia stared wildly at the short, blunt, and undoubtedly quite harmless knife she held in her hand."},{"id":1669,"text":"With a spasmodic movement she raised it high."},{"id":1670,"text":"Baley said, \"You couldn't reach me, Gladia.\"\r\n\r\nShe gasped. \"Who'd want to reach you?"},{"id":1671,"text":"Ugh!\" She shuddered in exaggerated disgust and called out, \"Break contact at once!\"\r\n\r\nThe last must have been to a robot out of the line of sight, and Gladia and her end of the room were gone and the original wall sprang back."},{"id":1672,"text":"Daneel said, \"Am I correct in believing you now consider this woman guilty?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Baley flatly. \"Whoever did this needed a great deal more of certain characteristics than this poor girl has.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has a temper.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of that?"},{"id":1673,"text":"Most people do."},{"id":1674,"text":"Remember, too, that she has been under a considerable strain for a considerable time."},{"id":1675,"text":"If I had been under a similar strain and someone had turned on me as she imagined I had turned on her, I might have done a great deal more than wave a foolish little knife.\"\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"I have not been able to deduce the technique of poisoning at a distance, as you say you have.\"\r\n\r\nBaley found it pleasant to be able to say, \"I know you haven't."},{"id":1676,"text":"You lack the capacity to decipher this particular puzzle.\"\r\n\r\nHe said it with finality and Daneel accepted the statement as calmly and as gravely as ever."},{"id":1677,"text":"Baley said, \"I have two jobs for you, Daneel.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what are they, Partner Elijah?\"\r\n\r\n\"First, get in touch with this Dr."},{"id":1678,"text":"Thool and find out Mrs."},{"id":1679,"text":"Del-\r\n\r\nmarre's condition at the time of the murder of her husband."},{"id":1680,"text":"How long she required treatment and so on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to determine something in particular?\"\r\n\r\n\"No."},{"id":1681,"text":"I'm just trying to accumulate data."},{"id":1682,"text":"It isn't easy on this world."},{"id":1683,"text":"Secondly, find out who will be taking Gruer's place as head of security and arrange a viewing session for me first thing in the morning."},{"id":1684,"text":"As for me,\" he said without pleasure in his mind, and with none in his voice, \"I'm going to bed and eventually, I hope, I'll sleep.\" Then, almost petulantly, \"Do you suppose I could get a decent bookfilm in this place?\"\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"I would suggest that you summon the robot in charge of the library.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaley felt oniy irritation at having to deal with the robot."},{"id":1685,"text":"He would much rather have browsed at will.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said, \"not a classic; just an ordinary piece of fiction dealing with everyday life on contemporary Solaria."},{"id":1686,"text":"About half a dozen of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe robot submitted (it would have to) but even as it manipulated the proper controls that plucked the requisite book-films out of their niches and transferred them first to an exit slot and then to Baley's hand, it rattled on in respectful tones about all the other categories in the library."},{"id":1687,"text":"The master might like an adventure romance of the days of exploration, it suggested, or an excellent view of chemistry, perhaps, with animated atom models, or a fantasy, or a Galactography."},{"id":1688,"text":"The list was endless."},{"id":1689,"text":"Baley waited grimly for his half dozen, said, \"These will do,\" reached with his own hands (his own hands) for a scanner and walked away."},{"id":1690,"text":"When the robot followed and said, \"Will you require help with the adjustment, master?\" Baley turned and snapped, \"No."},{"id":1691,"text":"Stay where you are.\"\r\n\r\nThe robot bowed and stayed."},{"id":1692,"text":"Lying in bed, with the headboard aglow, Baley almost regretted his decision."},{"id":1693,"text":"The scanner was like no model he had ever used and he began with no idea at all as to the method for threading the film."},{"id":1694,"text":"But he worked at it obstinately, and, eventually, by taking it apart and working it out bit by bit, he managed something."},{"id":1695,"text":"At least he could view the film and, if the focus left a bit to be desired, it was small payment for a moment's independence from the robots."},{"id":1696,"text":"In the next hour and a half he had skipped and switched through four of the six films and was disappointed."},{"id":1697,"text":"He had had a theory."},{"id":1698,"text":"There was no better way, he had thought, to get an insight into Solarian ways of life and thought than to read their novels."},{"id":1699,"text":"He needed that insight if he were to conduct the investigation sensibly."},{"id":1700,"text":"But now he had to abandon his theories."},{"id":1701,"text":"He had viewed novels and had succeeded only in learning of people with ridiculous problems who behaved foolishly and reacted mysteriously."},{"id":1702,"text":"Why should a woman abandon her job on discovering her child had entered the same profession and refuse to explain her reasons until unbearable and ridiculous complications had resulted?"},{"id":1703,"text":"Why should a doctor and an artist be humiliated at being assigned to one another and what was so noble about the doctor's insistence on entering robotic research?"},{"id":1704,"text":"He threaded the fifth novel into the scanner and adjusted it to his eyes."},{"id":1705,"text":"He was bone-weary."},{"id":1706,"text":"So weary, in fact, that he never afterward recalled anything of the fifth novel (which he believed to be a suspense story) except for the opening in which a new estate owner entered his mansion and looked through the past account films presented him by a respectful robot."},{"id":1707,"text":"Presumably he fell asleep then with the scanner on his head and all lights blazing."},{"id":1708,"text":"Presumably a robot, entering respectfully, had gently removed the scanner and put out the lights."},{"id":1709,"text":"In any case, he slept and dreamed of Jessie."},{"id":1710,"text":"All was as it had been."},{"id":1711,"text":"He had never left Earth."},{"id":1712,"text":"They were ready to travel to the community kitchen and then to see a subetheric show with friends."},{"id":1713,"text":"They would travel over the Expressways and see people and neither of them had a care in the world."},{"id":1714,"text":"He was happy."},{"id":1715,"text":"And Jessie was beautiful."},{"id":1716,"text":"She had lost weight somehow."},{"id":1717,"text":"Why should she be so slim?"},{"id":1718,"text":"And so beautiful?"},{"id":1719,"text":"And one other thing was wrong."},{"id":1720,"text":"Somehow the sun shone down on them."},{"id":1721,"text":"He looked up and there was only the vaulted base of the upper Levels visible, yet the sun shone down, blazing brightly on everything, and no one was afraid."},{"id":1722,"text":"Baley woke up, disturbed."},{"id":1723,"text":"He let the robots serve breakfast and did not speak to Daneel."},{"id":1724,"text":"He said nothing, asked nothing, downed excellent coffee without tasting it."},{"id":1725,"text":"Why had he dreamed of the visible-invisible sun?"},{"id":1726,"text":"He could understand dreaming of Earth and of Jessie, but what had the sun to do with it?"},{"id":1727,"text":"And why should the thought of it bother him, anyway?\r\n\r\n\"Partner Elijah,\" said Daneel gently.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Corwin Attlebish will be in viewing contact with you in half an hour."},{"id":1728,"text":"I have arranged that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who the hell is Corwin Whatchamacullum?\" asked Baley sharply, and refilled his coffee cup.\r\n\r\n\"He was Agent Gruer's chief aide, Partner Elijah, and is now Acting Head of Security.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then get him now.\"\r\n\r\n\"The appointment, as I explained, is for half an hour from now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care when it's for."},{"id":1729,"text":"Get him now."},{"id":1730,"text":"That's an order.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will make the attempt, Partner

call and, for the first time on Solaria, Baley saw a Spacer who looked like the usual Earthly conception of one."},{"id":1732,"text":"Attlebish was tall, lean, and bronze."},{"id":1733,"text":"His eyes were a light brown, his chin large and hard."},{"id":1734,"text":"He looked faintly like Daneel."},{"id":1735,"text":"But whereas Daneel was idealized, almost godlike, Corwin Attlebish had lines of humanity in his face."},{"id":1736,"text":"Attlebish was shaving."},{"id":1737,"text":"The small abrasive pencil gave out its spray of fine particles that swept over cheek and chin, biting off the hair neatly and then disintegrating into impalpable dust."},{"id":1738,"text":"Baley recognized the instrument through hearsay but had never seen one used before.\r\n\r\n\"You the Earthman?\" asked Attlebish slurringly through barely cracked lips, as the abrasive dust passed under his nose."},{"id":1739,"text":"Baley said, \"I'm Elijah Baley, Plainclothesman C-7."},{"id":1740,"text":"I'm from Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're early.\" Attlebish snapped his shaver shut and tossed it somewhere outside Baley's range of vision. \"What's on your mind, Earthman?\"\r\n\r\nBaley would not have enjoyed the other's tone of voice at the best of times."},{"id":1741,"text":"He burned now."},{"id":1742,"text":"He said, \"How is Agent Gruer?\"\r\n\r\nAttlebish said, \"He's still alive."},{"id":1743,"text":"He may stay alive.\"\r\n\r\nBaley nodded. \"Your poisoners here on Solaria don't know dosages."},{"id":1744,"text":"Lack of experience."},{"id":1745,"text":"They gave Gruer too much and he threw it up."},{"id":1746,"text":"Half the dose would have killed him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poisoners?"},{"id":1747,"text":"There is no evidence for poison.\"\r\n\r\nBaley stared.

his fingertips. \"You would scarcely know the metabolic problems that arise past the age of two fifty.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that's the case, have you obtained competent medical

wanted Daneel, as an Auroran, to know of the investigation."},{"id":1765,"text":"He said lamely, \"There were political implications.\"\r\n\r\nAttlebish crossed his arms and looked distant, bored, and faintly hostile. \"We have no politics on Solaria in the sense we hear of it on other worlds~ Hannis Gruer has been a good citizen, but he is imaginative."},{"id":1766,"text":"It was he who, having heard some story about you, urged that we import you."},{"id":1767,"text":"He even agreed to accept an Auroran companion for you as a condition."},{"id":1768,"text":"I did not think it necessary."},{"id":1769,"text":"There is no mystery."},{"id":1770,"text":"Rikaine Delmarre was killed by his wife and we shall find out how and why."},{"id":1771,"text":"Even if we do not, she will be genetically\r\n\r\nanalyzed and the proper measures taken."},{"id":1772,"text":"As for Gruer, your fantasy concerning poisoning is of no importance.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said incredulously, \"You seem to imply that I'm not needed here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe not."},{"id":1773,"text":"If you wish to return to Earth, you may do so."},{"id":1774,"text":"I may even say we urge you to.\"\r\n\r\nBaley was amazed at his own reaction."},{"id":1775,"text":"He cried, \"No, sir."},{"id":1776,"text":"I don't budge.\"\r\n\r\n\"We hired you, Plainclothesman."},{"id":1777,"text":"We can discharge you."},{"id":1778,"text":"You will return to your home planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!"},{"id":1779,"text":"You listen to me."},{"id":1780,"text":"I'd advise you to."},{"id":1781,"text":"You're a big-time Spacer and I'm an Earthman, but with all respect, with deepest and most humble apologies, you're scared.\"\r\n\r\n\"Withdraw that statement!\" Attlebish drew himself to his six-footplus, and stared down at the Earthman haughtily.\r\n\r\n\"You're scared as hell."},{"id":1782,"text":"You think you'll be next if you pursue this thing."},{"id":1783,"text":"You're giving in so they'll let you alone; so they'll leave you your miserable life.\" Baley had no notion who the \"they\" might be or if there were any \"they\" at all."},{"id":1784,"text":"He was striking out blindly at an arrogant Spacer and enjoying the thud his phrases made as they hit against the other's self-control.\r\n\r\n\"You will leave,\" said Attlebish, pointing his finger in cold anger, \"within the hour."},{"id":1785,"text":"There'll be no diplomatic considerations about this, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Save your threats, Spacer."},{"id":1786,"text":"Earth is nothing to you, I admit, but I'm not the only one here."},{"id":1787,"text":"May I introduce my partner, Daneel Olivaw."},{"id":1788,"text":"He's from Aurora."},{"id":1789,"text":"He doesn't talk much."},{"id":1790,"text":"He's not here to talk."},{"id":1791,"text":"I handle that department."},{"id":1792,"text":"But he listens awfully well."},{"id":1793,"text":"He doesn't miss a word.\r\n\r\n\"Let me put it straight, Attlebish\"-Baley used the unadorned name with relish-\"whatever monkeyshines are going on here on Solaria, Aurora and forty-odd other Outer Worlds are interested."},{"id":1794,"text":"If you kick us off, the next deputation to visit Solaria will consist of warships."},{"id":1795,"text":"I'm from Earth and I know how the system works."},{"id":1796,"text":"Hurt feelings mean warships by return trip.\"\r\n\r\nAttlebish transferred his regard to Daneel and seemed to be considering."},{"id":1797,"text":"His voice was gentler. \"There is nothing going on here that need concern anyone outside the planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gruer thought otherwise and my partner heard him.\" This was no time to cavil at a lie."},{"id":1798,"text":"Daneel turned to look at Baley, at the Earthman's last statement, but Baley paid no attention."},{"id":1799,"text":"He drove on: \"I intend to pursue this investigation."},{"id":1800,"text":"Ordinarily, there's nothing I wouldn't do to get back to Earth."},{"id":1801,"text":"Even just dreaming about it gets me so restless I can't sit."},{"id":1802,"text":"If I owned this robot-infested palace I'm living in now, I'd give it with the robots thrown in and you and all your lousy world to boot for a ticket home.\r\n\r\n\"But I won't be ordered off by you."},{"id":1803,"text":"Not while there's a case to which I've been assigned that's still open."},{"id":1804,"text":"Try getting rid of me against my will and you'll be looking down the throats of space-based artillery.\r\n\r\n\"What's more, from now on, this murder investigation is going to be run my way."},{"id":1805,"text":"I'm in charge."},{"id":1806,"text":"I see the people I want to see."},{"id":1807,"text":"I see them."},{"id":1808,"text":"I don't view them."},{"id":1809,"text":"I'm used to seeing and that's the way it's going to be."},{"id":1810,"text":"I'll want the official approval of your office for all of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is impossible, unbearable--\"\r\n\r\n\"Daneel, you tell him.\"\r\n\r\nThe humanoid's voice said dispassionately, \"As my partner has informed you, Agent Attlebish, we have been sent here to conduct a murder investigation."},{"id":1811,"text":"It is essential that we do so."},{"id":1812,"text":"We, of course, do not wish to disturb any of your customs and perhaps actual seeing will be unnecessary, although it would be helpful if you were to give approval for such seeing as becomes necessary as Plainclothesman Baley has requested."},{"id":1813,"text":"As to leaving the planet against our will, we feel that would be inadvisable, although we regret any feeling on your part or on the part of any Solarian that our remaining would be unpleasant.\"\r\n\r\nBaley listened to the stilted sentence structure with a dour stretching of his lips that was not a smile."},{"id":1814,"text":"To one who knew Daneel as a robot, it was all an attempt to do a job without giving offense to any human, not to Baley and not to Attlebish."},{"id":1815,"text":"To one who thought Daneel was an Auroran, a native of the oldest and most powerful militarily of the Outer Worlds, it sounded like a series of subtly courteous threats."},{"id":1816,"text":"Attlebish put the tips 0f his fingers to his forehead. \"I'll think about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not too long,\" said Baley, \"because I have some visiting to do within the hour, and not by viewer."},{"id":1817,"text":"Done viewing!\"\r\n\r\nHe signaled the robot to break contact, then he stared with surprise and pleasure at the place where Attlebish had been."},{"id":1818,"text":"None of this had been planned."},{"id":1819,"text":"It had all been impulse born of his dream and of Attlebish's unnecessary arrogance."},{"id":1820,"text":"But now that it had happened, he was glad."},{"id":1821,"text":"It was what he had wanted, really-to take control."},{"id":1822,"text":"He thought: Anyway, that was telling the dirty Spacer!"},{"id":1823,"text":"He wished the entire population of Earth could have been here to watch."},{"id":1824,"text":"The man looked such a Spacer, and that made it all the better, of course."},{"id":1825,"text":"All the better."},{"id":1826,"text":"Only, why this feeling of vehemence in the matter of seeing?"},{"id":1827,"text":"Baley scarcely understood that."},{"id":1828,"text":"He knew what he planned to do, and seeing (not viewing) was part of it."},{"id":1829,"text":"All right."},{"id":1830,"text":"Yet there had been the tight lift to his spirit when he spoke of seeing, as though he were ready to break down the walls of this mansion even though it served no purpose."},{"id":1831,"text":"Why?"},{"id":1832,"text":"There was something impelling him beside the case, something that had nothing to do even with the question of Earth's safety."},{"id":1833,"text":"But what?"},{"id":1834,"text":"Oddly, he remembered his dream again; the sun shining down through all the opaque layers of t'he gigantic underground Cities of Earth."},{"id":1835,"text":"Daneel said with thoughtfulness (as far as his voice could carry a recognizable emotion), \"I wonder, Partner Elijah, if this is entirely safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bluffing this character?"},{"id":1836,"text":"It worked."},{"id":1837,"text":"And it wasn't really a bluff."},{"id":1838,"text":"I think it is important to Aurora to find out what's going on on Solana, and that Aurora knows it."},{"id":1839,"text":"Thank you, by the way, for not catching me out in a misstatement.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the natural decision."},{"id":1840,"text":"To have borne you out did Agent Attlebish a certain rather subtle harm."},{"id":1841,"text":"To have given you the lie would have done you a greater and more direct harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Potentials countered and the higher one won out, eh, Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\"So it was, Partner Elijah."},{"id":1842,"text":"I understand that this process, in a\r\n\r\nless definable way, goes on within the human mind."},{"id":1843,"text":"I repeat, however, that this new proposal of yours is not safe.\"\r\n\r\n'Which new proposal is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not approve your notion of seeing people."},{"id":1844,"text":"By that I mean seeing as opposed to viewing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand you."},{"id":1845,"text":"I'm not asking for your approval.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have my instructions, Partner Elijah."},{"id":1846,"text":"What it was that Agent Hannis Gruer told you during my absence last night I cannot know."},{"id":1847,"text":"That he did say something is obvious from the change in your attitude toward this problem."},{"id":1848,"text":"However, in the light of my instructions, I can guess."},{"id":1849,"text":"He must have warned you of the possibility of danger to other planets arising from the situation on Solaria.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly Baley reached for his pipe."},{"id":1850,"text":"He did that occasionally and always there was the feeling of irritation when he found nothing and remembered he could not smoke."},{"id":1851,"text":"He said, \"There are only twenty thousand Solarians."},{"id":1852,"text":"What danger can they represent?\"\r\n\r\n\"My masters on Aurora have for some time been uneasy about Solaria."},{"id":1853,"text":"I have not been told all the information at their disposal-\"\r\n\r\n\"And what little you have been told you have been told not to repeat to me."},{"id":1854,"text":"Is that it?\" demanded Baley."},{"id":1855,"text":"Daneel said, \"There is a great deal to find out before this matter can be discussed freely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what are the Solarians doing?"},{"id":1856,"text":"New weapons?"},{"id":1857,"text":"Paid subversion?"},{"id":1858,"text":"A campaign of individual assassination?"},{"id":1859,"text":"What can twenty thousand people do against hundreds of millions of Spacers?\"\r\n\r\nDaneel remained silent."},{"id":1860,"text":"Baley said, \"I intend to find out, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not the way you have now proposed, Partner Elijah."},{"id":1861,"text":"I have been instructed most carefully to guard your safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would have to anyway."},{"id":1862,"text":"First Law!\"\r\n\r\n\"Over and above that, as well."},{"id":1863,"text":"In conflict between your safety and that of another I must guard yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course."},{"id":1864,"text":"I understand that."},{"id":1865,"text":"If anything happens to me, there is no further way in which you can remain on Solaria without complications that Aurora is not yet ready to face."},{"id":1866,"text":"As long as I'm alive, I'm here at Solaria's original request and so we can throw our weight around, if necessary, and make them keep us."},{"id":1867,"text":"If I'm dead, the whole situation is changed."},{"id":1868,"text":"Your orders are, then, to keep Baley alive."},{"id":1869,"text":"Am I right, Daneel?\"\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"I cannot presume to interpret the reasoning behind my orders.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"All right, don't worry."},{"id":1870,"text":"The open space won't kill me, If I do find it necessary to see anyone."},{"id":1871,"text":"I'll survive."},{"id":1872,"text":"I may even get used to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not the matter of open space alone, Partner Elijah,\" said Daneel. \"It is this matter of seeing Solarians."},{"id":1873,"text":"I do not approve of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the Spacers won't like it."},{"id":1874,"text":"Too bad if they don't."},{"id":1875,"text":"Let them wear nose filters and gloves."},{"id":1876,"text":"Let them spray the air."},{"id":1877,"text":"And if it offends their nice morals to see me in the flesh, let them wince and blush."},{"id":1878,"text":"But I intend to see them."},{"id":1879,"text":"I consider it necessary to do so and I will do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I cannot allow you to.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't allow me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely you see why, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Consider, then, that Agent Cruer, the key Solarian figure in the investigation of this murder, has been poisoned."},{"id":1880,"text":"Does it not follow that if I permit you to proceed in your plan for exposing yourself indiscriminately in actual person, the next victim will necessarily be you yourself."},{"id":1881,"text":"How then can I possibly permit you to leave the safety of this mansion?\"\r\n\r\n\"How will you stop me, Daneel?\"\r\n\r\n\"By force, if necessary, Partner Elijah,\" said Daneel calmly. \"Even if I must hurt you."},{"id":1882,"text":"If I do not do so, you will surely die.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"So the higher potential wins out again, Daneel."},{"id":1883,"text":"You will hurt me to keep me alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe hurting you will be necessary, Partner Elijah."},{"id":1884,"text":"You know that I am superior to you in strength and you will not attempt a useless resistance."},{"id":1885,"text":"If it should become necessary, however, I will be compelled to hurt you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could blast you down where you stand,\" said Baley. \"Right now!"},{"id":1886,"text":"There is nothing in my potentials to prevent me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had thought you might take this attitude at some time in our present relationship, Partner Elijah."},{"id":1887,"text":"Most particularly, the thought occurred to me during our trip to this mansion, when you grew momentarily violent in the ground-car .The destruction of myself is unimportant in comparison with your safety, but such destruction would cause you distress eventually and disturb the plans of my masters."},{"id":1888,"text":"It was one of my first cares, therefore, during your first sleeping period, to deprive your blaster of its charge.\"\r\n\r\nBaley's lips tightened."},{"id":1889,"text":"He was left without a charged blaster!"},{"id":1890,"text":"His hand dropped instantly to his holster."},{"id":1891,"text":"He drew his weapon and stared at the charge reading."},{"id":1892,"text":"It hugged zero."},{"id":1893,"text":"For a moment he balanced the lump of useless metal as though to hurl it directly into Daneel's face."},{"id":1894,"text":"What good?"},{"id":1895,"text":"The robot would dodge efficiently."},{"id":1896,"text":"Baley put the blaster back."},{"id":1897,"text":"It could be recharged in good time."},{"id":1898,"text":"Slowly, thoughtfully, he said, \"I'm not fooled by you, Daneel.\" \"In what way, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are too much the master."},{"id":1899,"text":"I am too completely stopped by you."},{"id":1900,"text":"Are you a robot?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have doubted me before,\" said Daneel.\r\n\r\n\"On Earth last year, I doubted whether R."},{"id":1901,"text":"Daneel Olivaw was truly a robot."},{"id":1902,"text":"It turned out he was."},{"id":1903,"text":"I believe he still is."},{"id":1904,"text":"My question, however is this: Are you R."},{"id":1905,"text":"Daneel Olivaw?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?"},{"id":1906,"text":"Daneel was designed to imitate a Spacer closely."},{"id":1907,"text":"Why could not a Spacer be made up to imitate Daneel closely?\"\r\n\r\n\"For what reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"To carry on an investigation here with greater initiative and capacity than ever a robot could."},{"id":1908,"text":"And yet by assuming Daneel's role, you could keep me safely under control by giving me a false consciousness of mastery."},{"id":1909,"text":"After all, you are working through me and I must be kept pliable.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this is not so, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why do all the Solarians we meet assume you to be human?"},{"id":1910,"text":"They are robotic experts."},{"id":1911,"text":"Are they so easily fooled?"},{"id":1912,"text":"It occurs to me that I cannot be one right against many wrong."},{"id":1913,"text":"It is far more likely that I am one wrong against many right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prove it,\" said Baley, moving slowly toward an end table and lifting a scrap-disposal unit. \"You can do that easily enough, if you are a robot."},{"id":1914,"text":"Show the metal beneath your skin.\"\r\n\r\nDaneel said, \"I assure you-\"\r\n\r\n\"Show the metal,\" said Baley crisply. \"That is an order!"},{"id":1915,"text":"Or don't you feel compelled to obey orders?\"\r\n\r\nDaneel unbuttoned his shirt."},{"id":1916,"text":"The smooth, bronze skin of his chest was sparsely covered with light hair."},{"id":1917,"text":"Daneel's fingers exerted a firm pressure just under the right nipple, and flesh and skin split bloodlessly the length of the chest, with the gleam of metal showing beneath."},{"id":1918,"text":"And as that happened, Baley's fingers, resting on the end table, moved half an inch to the right and stabbed at a contact patch."},{"id":1919,"text":"Almost at once a robot entered.\r\n\r\n\"Don't move, Daneel,\" cried Baley. \"That's an order!"},{"id":1920,"text":"Freeze!\"\r\n\r\nDaneel stood motionless, as though life, or the robotic imitation thereof, had departed from him."},{"id":1921,"text":"Baley shouted to the robot, \"Can you get two more of the staff in here without yourself leaving?"},{"id":1922,"text":"If so, do it.\"\r\n\r\nThe robot said, \"Yes, master.\"\r\n\r\nTwo more robots entered, answering a radioed call."},{"id":1923,"text":"The three lined up abreast.\r\n\r\n\"Boys!\" said Baley. \"Do you see this creature whom you thought a master?\"\r\n\r\nSix ruddy eyes had turned solemnly on Daneel."},{"id":1924,"text":"They said in unison, We see him, master."},{"id":1925,"text":"Baley said, \"Do you also see that this so-called master is actually a robot like yourself since it is metal within."},{"id":1926,"text":"It is only designed to look like a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not required to obey any order it gives you."},{"id":1927,"text":"Do you understand that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"I, on the other hand,\" said Baley, \"am a true man.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment the robots hesitated."},{"id":1928,"text":"Baley wondered if, having had it shown to them that a thing might seem a man yet be a robot, they would accept anything in human appearance as a man, anything at all."},{"id":1929,"text":"But then one robot said, \"You are a man, master,\" and Baley drew breath again."},{"id":1930,"text":"He said, \"Very well, Daneel."},{"id":1931,"text":"You may relax.\"\r\n\r\nDaneel moved into a more natural position and said calmly, \"Your expressed doubt as to my identity, then, was merely a feint designed to exhibit my nature to these others, I take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it was,\" said Baley, and looked away."},{"id":1932,"text":"He thought: The thing is a machine, not a man."},{"id":1933,"text":"You can't double-cross a machine."},{"id":1934,"text":"And yet he couldn't entirely repress a feeling of shame."},{"id":1935,"text":"Even as Daneel stood there, chest open, there seemed something so human about him, something capable of being betrayed."},{"id":1936,"text":"Baley said, \"Close your chest, Daneel, and listen to me."},{"id":1937,"text":"Physically, you are no match for three robots."},{"id":1938,"text":"You see that, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is clear, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! . . ."},{"id":1939,"text":"Now you boys,\" and he turned to the other robots again. \"You are to tell no one, human or master, that this creature is a robot."},{"id":1940,"text":"Never at any time, without further instructions from myself and myself alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you,\" interposed Daneel softly.\r\n\r\n\"However,\" Baley went on, \"thjs manlike robol is not to be allowed to interfere with my actions in any way."},{"id":1941,"text":"If it attempts any such interference, you will restrain it by force, taking care not to damage it unless absolutely necessary."},{"id":1942,"text":"Do not allow it to establish contact with humans other than myself, or with robots other than yourselves, either by seeing or by viewing."},{"id":1943,"text":"And do not leave it at any time."},{"id":1944,"text":"Keep it in this room and remain here yourselves."},{"id":1945,"text":"Your other duties are suspended until further notice."},{"id":1946,"text":"Is all this clear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master,\" they chorused."},{"id":1947,"text":"Baley turned to Daneel again. \"There is nothing you can do now, so don't try to stop me.\"\r\n\r\nDaneel's arms hung loosely at his side."},{"id":1948,"text":"He said, \"I may not, through inaction, allow you to come to harm, Partner Elijah."},{"id":1949,"text":"Yet under the circumstances, nothing but inaction is possible."},{"id":1950,"text":"The logic is unassailable."},{"id":1951,"text":"I shall do nothing."},{"id":1952,"text":"I trust you will remain safe and in good health.\"\r\n\r\nThere it was, thought Baley."},{"id":1953,"text":"Logic was logic and robots had nothing else."},{"id":1954,"text":"Logic told Daneel he was completely stymied."},{"id":1955,"text":"Reason might have told him that all factors are rarely predictable, that the opposition might make a mistake."},{"id":1956,"text":"None of that."},{"id":1957,"text":"A robot is logical only, not reasonable."},{"id":1958,"text":"Again Baley felt a twinge of shame and could not forbear an attempt at consolation."},{"id":1959,"text":"He said, \"Look, Daneel, even if I were walking into danger, which I'm not\" (he added that hurriedly, with a quick glance at the other robots) \"it would only be my job."},{"id":1960,"text":"It is what I'm paid to do."},{"id":1961,"text":"It is as much my job to prevent harm to mankind as a whole as yours is to prevent harm to man as an individual."},{"id":1962,"text":"Do you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not, Partner Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that is because you're not made to see."},{"id":1963,"text":"Take my word for it that if you were a man, you would see.\"\r\n\r\nDaneel bowed his head in acquiescence and remained standing, motionless, while Baley walked slowly toward the door of the room."},{"id":1964,"text":"The three robots parted to make room for him and kept their photoelectric eyes fixed firmly on Daneel."},{"id":1965,"text":"Baley was walking to a kind of freedom and his heart beat rapidly in anticipation of the fact, then skipped a beat."},{"id":1966,"text":"Another robot was approaching the door from the other side."},{"id":1967,"text":"Had something gone wrong?\r\n\r\n\"What is it, boy?\" he snapped.\r\n\r\n\"A message has been forwarded to you, master, from the office of Acting Head of Security Attlebish.\"\r\n\r\nBaley took the personal capsule handed to him and it opened at once."},{"id":1968,"text":"A finely inscribed strip of paper unrolled. (He wasn't startled."},{"id":1969,"text":"Solaria would have his fingerprints on file and the capsule would be adjusted to open at the touch of his particular convolutions.)\r\n\r\nHe read the message and his long face mirrored satisfaction."},{"id":1970,"text":"It was his official permission to arrange \"seeing\" interviews, subject to the wishes of the interviewees, who were nevertheless urged to give \"Agents Baley and Olivaw\" every possible co-operation."},{"id":1971,"text":"Attlebish had capitulated, even to the extent of putting the Earthman's name first."},{"id":1972,"text":"It was an excellent omen with which to begin, finally, an investigation conducted as it should be conducted."},{"id":1973,"text":"Baley was in an air-borne vessel again, as he had been on that trip from New York to Washington."},{"id":1974,"text":"This time, however, there was a difference."},{"id":1975,"text":"The vessel was not closed in."},{"id":1976,"text":"The windows were left transparent."},{"id":1977,"text":"It was a clear, bright day and from where Baley sat the windows were so many patches of blue."},{"id":1978,"text":"Unrelieved, featureless."},{"id":1979,"text":"He tried not to huddle."},{"id":1980,"text":"He buried his head in his knees only when he could absolutely no longer help it."},{"id":1981,"text":"The ordeal was of his own choosing."},{"id":1982,"text":"His state of triumph, his unusual sense of freedom at having beaten down first Attlebish and then Daneel, his feeling of having asserted the dignity of Earth against the Spacers, almost demanded it."},{"id":1983,"text":"He had begun by stepping across open ground to the waiting plane with a kind of lightheaded dizziness that was almost enjoyable, and he had ordered the windows left unbianked in a kind of manic self-confidence."},{"id":1984,"text":"I have to get used to it, he thought, and stared at the blue until his heart beat rapidly and the lump in his throat swelled beyond endurance."},{"id":1985,"text":"He had to close his eyes and bury his head under the protective cover of his arms at shortening intervals."},{"id":1986,"text":"Slowly his confidence trickled away and even the touch of the holster of his freshly recharged blaster could not reverse the flow."},{"id":1987,"text":"He tried to keep his mind on his plan of attack."},{"id":1988,"text":"First, learn the ways of the planet."},{"id":1989,"text":"Sketch in the background against which everything must be placed or fail to make sense."},{"id":1990,"text":"See a sociologist!"},{"id":1991,"text":"He had asked a robot for the name of the Solarian most eminent as a sociologist."},{"id":1992,"text":"And there was that comfort about robots; they asked no questions."},{"id":1993,"text":"The robot gave the name and vital statistics, and pau~ed to remark that the sociologist would most probably be at lunch and would, therefore, possibly ask to delay contact.\r\n\r\n\"Lunch!\" said Baley sharply. \"Don't be ridiculous."},{"id":1994,"text":"It's not noon by two hours.\"\r\n\r\nThe robot said, \"I am using local time, master.\"\r\n\r\nBaley stared, then understood."},{"id":1995,"text":"On Earth, with its buried Cities, day and night, waking and sleeping, were man-made periods, adjusted to suit the needs of the community and the planet."},{"id":1996,"text":"On a planet such as this one, exposed nakedly to the sun, day and night were not a matter of choice at all, but were imposed on man willyfilly."},{"id":1997,"text":"Baley tried to picture a world as a sphere being lit and unlit as it turned."},{"id":1998,"text":"He found it hard to do and felt scornful of the so-superior Spacers who let such an essential thing as time be dictated to them by the vagaries of planetary movements."},{"id":1999,"text":"He said, \"Contact him anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRobots were there to meet the plane when it landed and Baley, stepping out into the open again, found himself trembling badly."},{"id":2000,"text":"He muttered to the nearest of the robots, \"Let me hold your arm, boy.\"\r\n\r\nThe sociologist waited for him down the length of a hall, smiling tightly. \"Good afternoon, Mr."},{"id":2001,"text":"Baley.\"\r\n\r\nBaley nodded breathlessly. \"Good evening, sir."},{"id":2002,"text":"Would you blank out the windows?\"\r\n\r\nThe sociologist said, \"They are blanked out already."},{"id":2003,"text":"I know something of the ways of Earth."},{"id":2004,"text":"Will you follow me?\"\r\n\r\nBaley managed it without robotic help, following at a considerable distance, across and through a maze of hallways."},{"id":2005,"text":"When he finally sat down in a large and elaborate room, he was glad of the opportunity to rest."},{"id":2006,"text":"The walls of the room were set with curved, shallow alcoves."},{"id":2007,"text":"Statuary in pink and gold occupied each niche; abstract figures that pleased the eye without yielding instant meaning."},{"id":2008,"text":"A large, boxlike affair with white and dangling cylindrical objects and numerous pedals suggested a musical instrument."},{"id":2009,"text":"Baley looked at the sociologist standing before him."},{"id":2010,"text":"The Spacer looked precisely as he had when Baley had viewed him earlier that day."},{"id":2011,"text":"He was tall and thin and his hair was pure white."},{"id":2012,"text":"His face was strikingly wedge-shaped, his nose prominent, his eyes deep-set and alive."},{"id":2013,"text":"His name was Anselmo Quemot."},{"id":2014,"text":"They stared at one another until Baley felt he could trust his voice to be reasonably normal."},{"id":2015,"text":"And then his first remark had nothing to do with the investigation."},{"id":2016,"text":"In fact it was nothing he had planned."},{"id":2017,"text":"He said, \"May I have a drink?\"\r\n\r\n\"A drink?\" The sociologist's voice was a trifle too high-pitched to be entirely pleasant."},{"id":2018,"text":"He said, \"You wish water?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd prefer something alcoholic.\"\r\n\r\nThe sociologist's look grew sharply uneasy, as though the obligations of hospitality were something with which he was unacquainted."},{"id":2019,"text":"And that, thought Baley, was literally so."},{"id":2020,"text":"In a world where viewing was the thing, there would be no sharing of food and drink."},{"id":2021,"text":"A robot brought him a small cup of smooth enamel."},{"id":2022,"text":"The drink was a light pink in color."},{"id":2023,"text":"Baley sniffed at it cautiously and tasted it even more cautiously."},{"id":2024,"text":"The small sip of liquid evaporated warmly in his mouth and sent a pleasant message along the length of his esophagus."},{"id":2025,"text":"His next sip was more substantial."},{"id":2026,"text":"Quemot said, \"If you wish more-\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you, not now."},{"id":2027,"text":"It is good of you, sir, to agree to see me.\"\r\n\r\nQuemot tried a smile and failed rather markedly, \"It has been a long time since I've done anything like this."},{"id":2028,"text":"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nHe almost squirmed as he spoke."},{"id":2029,"text":"Baley said, \"I imagine you find this rather hard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite.\" Quemot turned away sharply and retreated to a chair at the opposite end of the room."},{"id":2030,"text":"He angled the chair so that it faced more away from Baley than toward him and sat down."},{"id":2031,"text":"He clasped his gloved hands and his nostrils seemed to quiver."},{"id":2032,"text":"Baley finished his drink and felt warmth in his limbs and even the return of something of his confidence."},{"id":2033,"text":"He said, \"Exactly how does it feel to have me here, Dr."},{"id":2034,"text":"Quemot?\" The sociologist muttered, \"That is an uncommonly personal question.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it is."},{"id":2035,"text":"But I think I explained when I viewed you earlier that I was engaged in a murder investigation and that I would have to ask a great many questions, some of which were bound to be personal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll help if I can,\" said Quemot. \"I hope the questions will be decent ones.\" He kept looking away as he spoke."},{"id":2036,"text":"His eyes, when they struck Baley's face, did not linger, but slipped away."},{"id":2037,"text":"Baley said, \"I don't ask about your feelings out of curiosity only."},{"id":2038,"text":"This is essential to the investigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got to know as much as I can about this world."},{"id":2039,"text":"I must understand how Solarians feel about ordinary matters."},{"id":2040,"text":"Do you see that?\"\r\n\r\nQuemot did not look at Baley at all now."},{"id":2041,"text":"He said slowly, \"Ten years ago, my wife died."},{"id":2042,"text":"Seeing her was never very easy, but, of course, it is something one learns to bear in time and she was not the intrusive sort."},{"id":2043,"text":"I have been assigned no new wife since I am past the age of-of\"-he looked at Baley as though requesting him to supply the phrase, and when Baley did not do so, he continued in a lower voice-\"siring."},{"id":2044,"text":"Without even a wife, I have grown quite unused to this phenomenon of seeing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how does it feel?\" insisted Baley. \"Are you in panic?\" He thought of himself on the plane.\r\n\r\n\"No."},{"id":2045,"text":"Not in panic.\" Quemot angled his head to catch a glimpse of Baley and almost instantly withdrew. \"But I will be frank, Mr."},{"id":2046,"text":"Baley."},{"id":2047,"text":"I imagine I can smell you.\"\r\n\r\nBaley automatically leaned back in his chair, painfully selfconscious. \"Smell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite imaginary, of course,\" said Quemot. \"I cannot say whether you do have an odor or how strong it is, but even if you had a strong one, my nose filters would keep it from me."},{"id":2048,"text":"Yet, imagination - . .\" He shrugged.\r\n\r\n\"I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's worse."},{"id":2049,"text":"You'll forgive me, Mr."},{"id":2050,"text":"Baley, but in the actual presence\r\n\r\nof a human, I feel strongly as though something slimy were about to touch me."},{"id":2051,"text":"I keep shrinking away."},{"id":2052,"text":"It is most unpleasant.\"\r\n\r\nBaley rubbed his ear thoughtfully and fought to keep down annoyance."},{"id":2053,"text":"After all, it was the other's neurotic reaction to a simple state of affairs."},{"id":2054,"text":"He said, \"If all this is so, I'm surprised you agreed to see me so readily."},{"id":2055,"text":"Surely you anticipated this unpleasantness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did."},{"id":2056,"text":"But you know, I was curious."},{"id":2057,"text":"You're an Earthman.\" Baley thought sardonically that that should have been another argument against seeing, but he said only, 'What does that matter?\"\r\n\r\nA kind of jerky enthusiasm entered Quemot's voice. \"It's not something I can explain easily."},{"id":2058,"text":"Not even to myself, really."},{"id":2059,"text":"But I've worked on sociology for ten years now."},{"id":2060,"text":"Really worked."},{"id":2061,"text":"I've developed propositions that are quite new and startling, and yet basically true."},{"id":2062,"text":"It is one of these propositions that makes me most extraordinarily interested in Earth and Earthmen."},{"id":2063,"text":"You see, if you were to consider Solaria's society and way of life carefully, it will become obvious to you that the said society and way of life is modeled directly and closely on that of Earth itself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaley could not prevent himself from crying out, 'What!\"\r\n\r\nQuemot looked over his shoulder as the moments of silence passed and said finally, \"Not Earth's present culture."},{"id":2064,"text":"No.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"Oh.\"\r\n\r\n\"But in the past, yes."},{"id":2065,"text":"Earth's ancient history."},{"id":2066,"text":"As an Earthman, you know it, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've viewed books,\" said Baley cautiously.\r\n\r\n\"Ah."},{"id":2067,"text":"Then you understand.\"\r\n\r\nBaley, who did not, said, \"Let me explain exactly what I want, Dr."},{"id":2068,"text":"Quemot."},{"id":2069,"text":"I want you to tell me what you can about why Solaria is so different from the other Outer Worlds, why there are so many robots, why you behave as you do."},{"id":2070,"text":"I'm sorry if I seem to be changing the subject.\"\r\n\r\nBaley most definitely wanted to change the subject."},{"id":2071,"text":"Any discussion of a likeness or unlikeness between Solaria's culture and Earth's would prove too absorbing by half."},{"id":2072,"text":"He might spend the day there and come away none the wiser as far as useful information was concerned."},{"id":2073,"text":"Quemot smiled. \"You want to compare Solaria and the other Outer Worlds and not Solaria and Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know Earth, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you wish.\" The Solarian coughed slightly. \"Do you mind if I turn my chair completely away from you?"},{"id":2074,"text":"It would be more-more comfortable.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you wish, Dr."},{"id":2075,"text":"Quemot,\" said Baley stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"Good.\" A robot turned the chair at Quemot's low-voiced order,\r\n\r\nand as the sociologist sat there, hidden from Baley's eyes by the substantial chair back, his voice took on added life and even deepened and strengthened in tone."},{"id":2076,"text":"Quemot said, \"Solaria was first settled about three hundred years ago."},{"id":2077,"text":"The original settlers were Nexonians."},{"id":2078,"text":"Are you acquainted with Nexon?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid not.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is close to Solaria, only about two parsecs away."},{"id":2079,"text":"In fact, Solana and Nexon represent the closest pair of inhabited worlds in the Galaxy."},{"id":2080,"text":"Solaria, even when uninhabited by man, was lifebearing and eminently suited for human occupation."},{"id":2081,"text":"It represented an obvious attraction to the well-to-do of Nexon, who found it difficult to maintain a proper standard of living as their own planet filled up.\"\r\n\r\nBaley interrupted. \"Filled up?"},{"id":2082,"text":"I thought Spacers practiced population control.\"\r\n\r\n\"Solaria does, but the Outer Worlds in general control it rather laxly."},{"id":2083,"text":"Nexon was completing its second million of population at the time I speak of."},{"id":2084,"text":"There was sufficient crowding to make it necessary to regulate the number of robots that might be owned by a particular family."},{"id":2085,"text":"So those Nexonians who could established summer homes on Solaria, which was fertile, temperate, and without dangerous fauna.\r\n\r\n\"The settlers on Solaria could still reach Nexon without too much trouble and while on Solaria they could live as they pleased."},{"id":2086,"text":"They could use as many robots as they could afford or felt a need for."},{"id":2087,"text":"Estates could be as large as desired since, with an empty planet, room was no problem, and with unlimited robots, exploitation was no problem.\r\n\r\n\"Robots grew to be so many that they were outfitted with radio contact and that was the beginning of our famous robot industries."},{"id":2088,"text":"We began to develop new varieties, new attachments, new capabilities."},{"id":2089,"text":"Culture dictates invention; a phrase I believe I have invented.\" Quemot chuckled."},{"id":2090,"text":"A robot, responding to some stimulus Baley could not see beyond the barrier of the chair, brought Quemot a drink similar to that Baley had had earlier."},{"id":2091,"text":"None was brought to Baley, and he decided not to ask for one."},{"id":2092,"text":"Quemot went on, \"The advantages of life on Solaria were obvious to all who watched."},{"id":2093,"text":"Solaria became fashionable."},{"id":2094,"text":"More Nexoni\r\n\r\nans established homes, and Solaria became what I like to call a 'villa planet.' And of the settlers, more and more took to remaining on the planet all year round and carrying on their bi~isiness on Nexon through proxies."},{"id":2095,"text":"Robot factories were established on Solaria."},{"id":2096,"text":"Farms and mines began to be exploited to the point where exports were possible.\r\n\r\n\"In short, Mr."},{"id":2097,"text":"Baley, it became obvious that Solaria, in the space of a century or less, would be as crowded as Nexon had been."},{"id":2098,"text":"It seemed ridiculous and wasteful to find such a new world and then lose it through lack of foresight.\r\n\r\n\"To spare you a great deal of complicated politics, I need say only that Solaria managed to establish its independence and make it stick without war."},{"id":2099,"text":"Our usefulness to other Outer Worlds as a source of specialty robots gained us friends and helped us, of course.\r\n\r\n\"Once independent, our first care was to make sure that population did not grow beyond reasonable limits."},{"id":2100,"text":"We regulate immigration and births and take care of all needs by increasing and diversifying the robots we use.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, 'Why is it the Solarians object to seeing one another?\" He felt annoyed at the manner in which Quemot chose to expound sociology."},{"id":2101,"text":"Quemot peeped around the corner of his chair and retreated almost at once. \"It follows inevitably."},{"id":2102,"text":"We have huge estates."},{"id":2103,"text":"An estate ten thousand square miles in area is not uncommon, although the largest ones contain considerable unproductive areas."},{"id":2104,"text":"My own estate is nine hundred fifty square miles in area but every bit of it is good land.\r\n\r\n\"In any case, it is the size of an estate, more than anything else, that determines a man's position in society."},{"id":2105,"text":"And one property of a large estate is this: You can wander about in it almost aimlessly with little or no danger of entering a neighbor's territory and thus encountering your neighbor."},{"id":2106,"text":"You see?\"\r\n\r\nBaley shrugged. \"I suppose I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"In short, a Solarian takes pride in not meeting his neighbor."},{"id":2107,"text":"At the same time, his estate is so well run by robots and so self-sufficient that there is no reason for him to have to meet his neighbor."},{"id":2108,"text":"The desire not to do so led to the development of ever more perfect viewing equipment, and as the viewing equipment grew better there was\r\n\r\nless and less need ever to see one's neighbor."},{"id":2109,"text":"It was a reinforcing cycle, a kind of feed-back."},{"id":2110,"text":"Do you see?\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"Look here, Dr."},{"id":2111,"text":"Quemot."},{"id":2112,"text":"You don't have to make all this so simple for me."},{"id":2113,"text":"I'm not a sociologist but I've had the usual elementary courses in college."},{"id":2114,"text":"It's only an Earth college, of course,\" Baley added with a reluctant modesty designed to ward off the same comment, in more insulting terms, from the other, \"but I can follow mathematics.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mathematics?\" said Quemot, his voice squeaking the last syllable.\r\n\r\n\"Well, not the stuff they use in robotics, which I wouldn't follow, but sociological relationships I can handle."},{"id":2115,"text":"For instance, I'm familiar with the Teramin Relationship.\"\r\n\r\n\"The what, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you have a different name for it."},{"id":2116,"text":"The differential of inconveniences suffered with privileges granted: dee eye sub jay taken to the nth--\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" It was the sharp and peremptory tone of a Spacer that Baley heard and he was silenced in bewilderment."},{"id":2117,"text":"Surely the relationship between inconveniences suffered and privileges granted was part of the very essentials of learning how to handle people without an explosion."},{"id":2118,"text":"A private stall in the community bathroom for one person, given for cause, would keep x persons waiting patiently for the same lightning to strike them, the value of x varying in known ways with known variations in environment and human temperament, as quantitatively described in the Teramm Relationship."},{"id":2119,"text":"But then again, in a world where all was privilege and nothing inconvenience, the Teramin Relationship might reduce to triviality."},{"id":2120,"text":"Perhaps he had chosen the wrong example."},{"id":2121,"text":"He tried again. \"Look, sir, it's one thing to get a qualitative fill-in on the growth of this prejudice against seeing, but it isn't helpful for my purposes."},{"id":2122,"text":"I want to know the exact analysis of the prejudice so I can counteract it effectively."},{"id":2123,"text":"I want to persuade people to see me, as you are doing now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr."},{"id":2124,"text":"Baley,\" said Quemot, \"you can't treat human emotions as though they were built about a positronic brain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not saying you can."},{"id":2125,"text":"Robotics is a deductive science and soci\r\n\r\nology an inductive one."},{"id":2126,"text":"But mathematics can be made to apply in either case.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment."},{"id":2127,"text":"Then Quemot spoke in a voice that trembled. \"You have admitted you are not a sociologist.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know."},{"id":2128,"text":"But I was told you were one."},{"id":2129,"text":"The best on the planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the only one."},{"id":2130,"text":"You might almost say I have invented the science.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh?\" Baley hesitated over the next question."},{"id":2131,"text":"It sounded impertinent even to himself. \"Have you viewed books on the subject?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've looked at some Auroran books.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you looked at books from Earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Earth?\" Quemot laughed uneasily. \"It wouldn't have occurred to me to read any of Earth's scientific productions."},{"id":2132,"text":"No offense intended.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry."},{"id":2133,"text":"I had thought I would be able to get specific data that would make it possible for me to interview others face to face without having to--\"\r\n\r\nQuemot made a queer, grating, inarticulate sound and the large chair in which he sat scraped backward, then went over with a crash."},{"id":2134,"text":"A muffled \"My apologies\" was caught by Baley."},{"id":2135,"text":"Baley had a momentary glimpse of Quemot running with an ungainly stride, then he was out the room and gone."},{"id":2136,"text":"Baley's eyebrows lifted."},{"id":2137,"text":"What the devil had he said this time?"},{"id":2138,"text":"Jehoshaphat!"},{"id":2139,"text":"What wrong button had he pushed?"},{"id":2140,"text":"Tentatively he rose from his seat, and stopped halfway as a robot entered.\r\n\r\n\"Master,\" said the robot, \"I have been directed to inform you that the master will view you in a few moments.\"\r\n\r\n\"View me, boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master."},{"id":2141,"text":"In the meanwhile, you may desire further refreshment.\"\r\n\r\nAnother beaker of the pink liquid was at Baley's elbow and this time a dish of some confectionary, warm and fragrant, was added."},{"id":2142,"text":"Baley took his seat again, sampled the liquor cautiously and put it down."},{"id":2143,"text":"The confectionary was hard to the touch and warm, but the crust broke easily in the mouth and the inner portion was at once considerably warmer and softer."},{"id":2144,"text":"He could not identify the corn-\r\n\r\nponents of the taste and wondered if it might not be a product of the native spices or condiments of Solaria."},{"id":2145,"text":"Then he thought of the restricted, yeast-derived dietary of Earth and wondered if there might be a market for yeast strains designed to imitate the tastes of Outer World products."},{"id":2146,"text":"But his thoughts broke off sharply as sociologist Quemot appeared out of nowhere and faced him."},{"id":2147,"text":"Faced him this time!"},{"id":2148,"text":"He sat in a smaller chair in a room in which the walls and floor clashed sharply with those surrounding Baley."},{"id":2149,"text":"And he was smiling now, so that fine wrinkles in his face deepened and, paradoxically, gave him a more youthful appearance by accentuating the life in his eyes."},{"id":2150,"text":"He said, \"A thousand pardons, Mr."},{"id":2151,"text":"Baley."},{"id":2152,"text":"I thought I was enduring personal presence so well, but that was a delusion."},{"id":2153,"text":"I was quite on edge and your phrase pushed me over it, in a manner of speaking.\"\r\n\r\n'What phrase was that, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"You said something about interviewing people face to-\" He shook his head, his tongue dabbing quickly at his lips. \"I would rather not say it."},{"id":2154,"text":"I think you know what I mean."},{"id":2155,"text":"The phrase conjured up the most striking picture of the two of us breathing-breathing one another's breath.\" The Solarian shuddered. \"Don't you find that repulsive?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that I've ever thought of it so.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems so filthy a habit."},{"id":2156,"text":"And as you said it and the picture arose in my mind, I realized that after all we were in the same room and even though I was not facing you, puffs of air that had been in your lungs must be reaching me and entering mine."},{"id":2157,"text":"With my sensitive frame of mind--\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"Molecules all over Solaria's atmosphere have been in thousands of lungs."},{"id":2158,"text":"Jehoshaphat!"},{"id":2159,"text":"They've been in the lungs of animals and the gills of fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" said Quemot with a rueful rub of his cheek, \"and I'd just as soon not think of that, either."},{"id":2160,"text":"However there was a sense of immediacy to the situation with yourself actually there and with both of us inhaling and exhaling."},{"id":2161,"text":"It's amazing the relief I feel in viewing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm still in the same house, Dr."},{"id":2162,"text":"Quemot.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's precisely what is so amazing about the relief."},{"id":2163,"text":"You are in the same house and yet just the use of the trimensionals makes all\r\n\r\nthe difference."},{"id":2164,"text":"At least I know what seeing a stranger feels like now."},{"id":2165,"text":"I won't try it again.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds as though you were experimenting with seeing.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a way,\" said the Spacer, \"I suppose I was."},{"id":2166,"text":"It was a minor motivation."},{"id":2167,"text":"And the results were interesting, even if they were disturbing as well."},{"id":2168,"text":"It was a good test and I may record it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Record what?\" asked Baley, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"My feelings!\" Quemot returned puzzled stare for puzzled stare."},{"id":2169,"text":"Baley sighed."},{"id":2170,"text":"Cross-purposes."},{"id":2171,"text":"Always cross-purposes. \"I only asked because somehow I assumed you would have instruments of some sort to measure emotional responses."},{"id":2172,"text":"An electroencephalograph, perhaps.\" He looked about fruitlessly, \"Though I suppose you could have a pocket version of the same that works without direct electrical connection."},{"id":2173,"text":"We don't have anything like that on Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust,\" said the Solarian stiffly, \"that I am able to estimate the nature of my own feelings without an instrument."},{"id":2174,"text":"They were pronounced enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course, but for quantitative analysis . . .\" began Baley."},{"id":2175,"text":"Quemot said querulously, \"I don't know what you're driving at."},{"id":2176,"text":"Besides I'm trying to tell you something else, my own theory, in fact, something I have viewed in no books, something I am quite proud\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"Exactly what is that, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the manner in which Solaria's culture is based on one existing in Earth's past.\"\r\n\r\nBaley sighed."},{"id":2177,"text":"If he didn't allow the other to get it off his chest, there might be very little co-operation thereafter."},{"id":2178,"text":"He said, \"And that is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sparta!\" said Quemot, lifting his head so that for a moment his white hair glistened in the light and seemed almost a halo. \"I'm sure you've heard of Sparta!\"\r\n\r\nBaley felt relieved."},{"id":2179,"text":"He had been mightily interested in Earth's ancient past in his younger days (it was an attractive study to many Earthmen-an Earth supreme because it was an Earth alone; Earthmen the masters because there were no Spacers), but Earth's past was a large one."},{"id":2180,"text":"Quemot might well have referred to some phase with which Baley was unacquainted and that would have been embarrassing."},{"id":2181,"text":"As it was, he could say cautiously, \"Yes."},{"id":2182,"text":"I've viewed films on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good."},{"id":2183,"text":"Good."},{"id":2184,"text":"Now Sparta in its heydey consisted of a relatively small number of Spartiates, the only full citizens, plus a somewhat larger number of second-class individuals, the Perioeci, and a really large number of outright slaves, the Helots."},{"id":2185,"text":"The Helots outnumbered the Spartiates a matter of twenty to one, and the Helots were men with human feelings and human failings.\r\n\r\n\"In order to make certain that a Helot rebellion could never be successful despite their overwhelming numbers, the Spartans became military specialists."},{"id":2186,"text":"Each lived the life of a military machine, and the society achieved its purpose."},{"id":2187,"text":"There was never a successful Helot revolt.\r\n\r\n\"Now we human beings on Solaria are equivalent, in a way, to the Spartiates."},{"id":2188,"text":"We have our Helots, but our Helots aren't men but machines."},{"id":2189,"text":"They cannot revolt and need not be feared even though they outnumber us a thousand times as badly as the Spartans' human Helots outnumbered them."},{"id":2190,"text":"So we have the advantage of Spartiate exclusiveness without any need to sacrifice ourselves to rigid mastery."},{"id":2191,"text":"We can, instead, model ourselves on the artistic and cultural way of life of the Athenians, who were contemporaries of the Spartans and who--\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"I've viewed films on the Athenians, too.\"\r\n\r\nQuemot grew warmer as he spoke. \"Civilizations have always been pyramidal in structure."},{"id":2192,"text":"As one climbs toward the apex of the social edifice, there is increased leisure and increasing opportunity to pursue happiness."},{"id":2193,"text":"As one climbs, one finds also fewer and fewer people to enjoy this more and more."},{"id":2194,"text":"Invariably, there is a preponderance of the dispossessed."},{"id":2195,"text":"And remember this, no matter how well off the bottom layers of the pyramid might be on an absolute scale, they are always dispossessed in comparison with the apex."},{"id":2196,"text":"For instance, even the most poorly off humans on Aurora are better off than Earth's aristocrats, but they are dispossessed with respect to Aurora's aristocrats, and it is with the masters of their own world that they compare themselves.\r\n\r\n\"So there is always social friction in ordinary human societies."},{"id":2197,"text":"The action of social revolution and the reaction of guarding against such revolution or combating it once it has begun are the causes of a great deal of the human misery with which history is permeated.\r\n\r\n\"Now here on Solaria, for the first time, the apex of the pyramid stands alone."},{"id":2198,"text":"In the place of the dispossessed are the robots."},{"id":2199,"text":"We have the first new society, the first really new one, the first great social invention since the farmers of Sumeria and Egypt invented cities.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat back now, smiling."},{"id":2200,"text":"Baley nodded. \"Have you published this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I may,\" said Quemot with an affectation of carelessness, \"someday."},{"id":2201,"text":"I haven't yet."},{"id":2202,"text":"This is my third contribution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were the other two as broad as this?\"\r\n\r\n\"They weren't in sociology."},{"id":2203,"text":"I have been a sculptor in my time."},{"id":2204,"text":"The work you see about you\"-he indicated the statuary-\"is my own."},{"id":2205,"text":"And I have been a composer, too."},{"id":2206,"text":"But I am getting older and Rikaine Delmarre always argued strongly in favor of the applied arts rather than the fine arts and I decided to go into sociology.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"That sounds as though Delmarre was a good friend of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"We knew one another."},{"id":2207,"text":"At my time in life, one knows all adult Solarians."},{"id":2208,"text":"But there is no reason not to agree that Rikaine Delmarre and I were well acquainted.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of a man was Delmarre?\" (Strangely enough, the name of the man brought up the picture of Gladia in Baley's mind and he was plagued with a sudden, sharp recall of her as he had last seen her, furious, her face distorted with anger at him.)\r\n\r\nQuemot looked a bit thoughtful. \"He was a worthy man; devoted to Solaria and to its way of life.\"\r\n\r\n\"An idealist, in other words.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes."},{"id":2209,"text":"Definitely."},{"id":2210,"text":"You could see that in the fact that he volunteered for his job as-as fetal engineer."},{"id":2211,"text":"It was an applied art, you see, and I told you his feelings about that.\"\r\n\r\n'Was volunteering unusual?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't you say-- But I forget you're an Earthman."},{"id":2212,"text":"Yes, it is unusual."},{"id":2213,"text":"It's one of those jobs that must be done, yet finds no voluntary takers."},{"id":2214,"text":"Ordinarily, someone must be assigned to it for a period of so many years and it isn't pleasant to be the one chosen."},{"id":2215,"text":"Delmarre volunteered, and for life."},{"id":2216,"text":"He felt the position was too important to be left to reluctant draftees, and he persuaded me into that opinion, too."},{"id":2217,"text":"Yet I certainly would never have volunteered."},{"id":2218,"text":"I couldn't pos\r\n\r\nsibly make the personal sacrifice."},{"id":2219,"text":"And it was more of a sacrifice for him, since he was almost a fanatic in personal hygiene.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm still not certain I understand the nature of his job.\"\r\n\r\nQuemot's old cheeks flushed gently. \"Hadn't you better discuss that with his assistant?\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"I would certainly have done so by now, sir, if anyone had seen fit to tell me before this moment that he had an assistant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry about that,\" said Quemot, \"but the existence of the assistant is another measure of his social responsibility."},{"id":2220,"text":"No previous occupant of the post provided for one."},{"id":2221,"text":"Delmarre, however, felt it necessary to find a suitable youngster and conduct the necessary training himself so as to leave a professional heir behind when the time came for him to retire or, well, to die.\" The old Solarian sighed heavily. \"Yet I outlived him and he was so much younger."},{"id":2222,"text":"I used to play chess with him."},{"id":2223,"text":"Many times.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you manage that?\"\r\n\r\nQuemot's eyebrows lifted. \"The usual way.\"\r\n\r\n\"You saw one another?\"\r\n\r\nQuemot looked horrified. 'What an idea!"},{"id":2224,"text":"Even if I could stomach it, Delmarre would never allow it for an instant."},{"id":2225,"text":"Being fetal engineer didn't blunt his sensibilities."},{"id":2226,"text":"He was a finicky man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how--\"\r\n\r\n\"With two boards as any two people would play chess.\" The Solarian shrugged in a sudden gesture of tolerance. \"Well, you're an Earthman."},{"id":2227,"text":"My moves registered on his board, and his on mine."},{"id":2228,"text":"It's a simple matter.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"Do you know Mrs."},{"id":2229,"text":"Delmarre?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've viewed one another."},{"id":2230,"text":"She's a field colorist, you know, and I've viewed some of her showings."},{"id":2231,"text":"Fine work in a way but more interesting as curiosities than as creations."},{"id":2232,"text":"Still, they're amusing and show a perceptive mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she capable of killing her husband, would you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't given it thought."},{"id":2233,"text":"Women are surprising creatures."},{"id":2234,"text":"But then, there's scarcely room for argument, is there?"},{"id":2235,"text":"Only Mrs."},{"id":2236,"text":"Delmarre could have been close enough to Rikaine to kill him."},{"id":2237,"text":"Rikaine would never, under any circumstances, have allowed anyone else seeing privileges for any reason."},{"id":2238,"text":"Extremely finicky."},{"id":2239,"text":"Perhaps finicky is the wrong word."},{"id":2240,"text":"It was just that he lacked any trace of abnormality; anything of the perverse."},{"id":2241,"text":"He was a good Solarian.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you call your granting me seeing privileges perverse?\" asked Baley."},{"id":2242,"text":"Quemot said, \"Yes, I think I would."},{"id":2243,"text":"I should say there was a bit of scatophilia involved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gould Delmarre have been killed for political reasons?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heard him called a Traditionalist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we all are.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean there is no group of Solarians who are not Traditionalists?\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say there are some,\" said Quemot slowly, \"who think it is dangerous to be too Traditionalist."},{"id":2244,"text":"They are overconscious of our small population, of the way the other worlds outnumber us."},{"id":2245,"text":"They think we are defenseless against possible aggression from the other Outer Worlds."},{"id":2246,"text":"They're quite foolish to think so and there aren't many of them."},{"id":2247,"text":"I don't think they're a force.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you say they are foolish?"},{"id":2248,"text":"Is there anything about Solaria that would affect the balance of power in spite of the great disadvantage of numbers?"},{"id":2249,"text":"Some new type of weapon?\"\r\n\r\n\"A weapon, certainly."},{"id":2250,"text":"But not a new one."},{"id":2251,"text":"The people I speak of are more blind than foolish not to realize that stich a weapon is in operation continuously and cannot be resisted.\"\r\n\r\nBaley's eyes narrowed. \"Are you serious?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the nature of the weapon?\"\r\n\r\n\"All of us must."},{"id":2252,"text":"You do, if you stop to think of it."},{"id":2253,"text":"I see it a trifle easier than most, perhaps, since I am a sociologist."},{"id":2254,"text":"To be sure, it isn't used as a weapon ordinarily is used."},{"id":2255,"text":"It doesn't kill or hurt, but it is irresistible even so."},{"id":2256,"text":"All the more irresistible because no one notices it.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said with annoyance, \"And just what is this non-lethal weapon?\"\r\n\r\nQuemot said, \"The positronic robot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment Baley went cold."},{"id":2257,"text":"The positronic robot was the symbol of Spacer superiority over Earthmen."},{"id":2258,"text":"That was weapon enough."},{"id":2259,"text":"He kept his voice steady. \"It's an economic weapon."},{"id":2260,"text":"Solaria is important to the other Outer Worlds as a source of advanced models and so it will not be harmed by them.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's an obvious point,\" said Quemot indifferently. \"That helped us establish our independence."},{"id":2261,"text":"What I have in mind is something else, something more subtle and more cosmic.\" Quemot's eyes were fixed on his fingers' ends and his mind was obviously fixed on abstractions."},{"id":2262,"text":"Baley said, \"Is this another of your sociological theories?\"\r\n\r\nQuemot's poorly suppressed look of pride all but forced a short smile out of the Earthman."},{"id":2263,"text":"The sociologist said, \"It is indeed mine."},{"id":2264,"text":"Original, as far as I know, and yet obvious if population data on the Outer Worlds is carefully studied."},{"id":2265,"text":"To begin with, ever since the positronic robot was invented, it has been used more and more intensively everywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on Earth,\" said Baley.\r\n\r\n\"Now, now, Plainclothesman."},{"id":2266,"text":"I don't know much of your Earth, but I know enough to know that robots are entering your economy."},{"id":2267,"text":"You people live in large Cities and leave most of your planetary surface unoccupied."},{"id":2268,"text":"Who runs your farms and mines, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Robots,\" admitted Baley. \"But if it comes to that, Doctor, Earthmen invented the positronic robot in the first place.\"\r\n\r\n\"They did?"},{"id":2269,"text":"Are you sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can check."},{"id":2270,"text":"It's true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Interesting."},{"id":2271,"text":"Yet robots made the least headway there.\" The sociologist said thoughtfully, \"Perhaps that is because of Earth's large population."},{"id":2272,"text":"It would take that much longer."},{"id":2273,"text":"Yes. . ."},{"id":2274,"text":"Still, you have robots even in your Cities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Baley.\r\n\r\n\"More now than, say, fifty years ago.\"\r\n\r\nBaley nodded impatiently. \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it fits."},{"id":2275,"text":"The difference is only one of time."},{"id":2276,"text":"Robots tend to displace human labor."},{"id":2277,"text":"The robot economy moves in only one direction."},{"id":2278,"text":"More robots and fewer humans."},{"id":2279,"text":"I've studied population data very carefully and I've plotted it and made a few extrapolations.\" He paused in sudden surprise. \"Why, that's rather an application of mathematics to sociology, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" said Baley.\r\n\r\n\"There may be something to it, at that."},{"id":2280,"text":"I will have to give the matter thought."},{"id":2281,"text":"In any case, these are the conclusions I have come to, and I am convinced there is no doubt as to their correctness."},{"id":2282,"text":"The robot-human ratio in any economy that has accepted robot labor tends continuously to increase despite any laws that are passed to prevent it."},{"id":2283,"text":"The increase is slowed, but never stopped."},{"id":2284,"text":"At first the human population increases, but the robot population increases much more quickly."},{"id":2285,"text":"Then, after a certain critical point is reached . ."},{"id":2286,"text":"Quemot stopped again, then said, \"Now let's see."},{"id":2287,"text":"I wonder if the critical point could be determined exactly; if you could really put a figure to it."},{"id":2288,"text":"There's your mathematics again.\"\r\n\r\nBaley stirred restlessly. \"What happens after the critical point is reached, Dr."},{"id":2289,"text":"Quemot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh?"},{"id":2290,"text":"Oh, the human population begins actually to decline."},{"id":2291,"text":"A planet approaches a true social stability."},{"id":2292,"text":"Aurora will have to."},{"id":2293,"text":"Even your Earth will have to."},{"id":2294,"text":"Earth may take a few more centuries, but it is inevitable.\"\r\n\r\n'What do you mean by social stability?\"\r\n\r\n\"The situation here."},{"id":2295,"text":"In Solaria."},{"id":2296,"text":"A world in which the humans are the leisure class only."},{"id":2297,"text":"So there is no reason to fear the other Outer Worlds."},{"id":2298,"text":"We need only wait a century perhaps and they shall all be Solarias."},{"id":2299,"text":"I suppose that will be the end of human history, in a way; at least, its fulfillment."},{"id":2300,"text":"Finally, finally, all men will have all they can need and want."},{"id":2301,"text":"You know, there is a phrase I once picked up; I\r\n\r\ndon't know where it comes from; something about the pursuit of happiness.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said thoughtfully, \"All men are 'endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. . ."},{"id":2302,"text":"among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've hit it."},{"id":2303,"text":"Where's that from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some old document,\" said Baley.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see how that is changed here on Solaria and eventually in all the Galaxy?"},{"id":2304,"text":"The pursuit will be over."},{"id":2305,"text":"The rights mankind will be heir to will be life, liberty, and happiness."},{"id":2306,"text":"Just that."},{"id":2307,"text":"Happiness.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said dryly, \"Maybe so, but a man has been killed on your Solaria and another may yet die.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt regret almost the moment he spoke, for the expression on Quemot's face was as though he had been struck with an open palm."},{"id":2308,"text":"The old man's head bowed."},{"id":2309,"text":"He said without looking up, \"I have answered your questions as well as I could."},{"id":2310,"text":"Is there anything else you wish?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have enough."},{"id":2311,"text":"Thank you, sir."},{"id":2312,"text":"I am sorry to have intruded on your grief at your friend's death.\"\r\n\r\nQuemot looked up slowly. \"It will be hard to find another chess partner."},{"id":2313,"text":"He kept our appointments most punctually and he played an extraordinarily even game."},{"id":2314,"text":"He was a good Solarian.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" said Baley softly. \"May I have your permission to use your viewer to make contact with the next person I must see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Quemot. \"My robots are yours."},{"id":2315,"text":"And now I will leave you."},{"id":2316,"text":"Done viewing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA robot was at Baley's side within thirty seconds of Quemot's disappearance and Baley wondered once again how these creatures were managed."},{"id":2317,"text":"He had seen Quemot's fingers move toward a contact as he had left and that was all."},{"id":2318,"text":"Perhaps the signal was quite a generalized one, saying only, \"Do your duty!\" Perhaps robots listened to all that went on and were always aware of what a human might desire at any given moment, and if the particular robot was not designed for a particular job in either mind or body, the radio web that united all robots went into action and the correct robot was spurred into action."},{"id":2319,"text":"For a moment Baley had the vision of Solaria as a robotic net with holes that were small and continually growing smaller, with every\r\n\r\nhuman being caught neatly in place."},{"id":2320,"text":"He thought of Quemot's picture of worlds turning into Solarias; of nets formitig and tightening even on Earth, until- His thoughts were disrupted as the robot who had entered spoke\r\n\r\nwith the quiet and even respect of the machine. \"I am ready to help you, master.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"Do you know how to reach the place where Rikaine Delmarre once worked?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master.\"\r\n\r\nBaley shrugged."},{"id":2321,"text":"He would never teach himself to avoid asking useless questions."},{"id":2322,"text":"The robots knew."},{"id":2323,"text":"Period."},{"id":2324,"text":"It occurred to him that, to handle robots with true efficiency, one must needs be expert, a sort of roboticist."},{"id":2325,"text":"How well did the average Solarian do, he wondered?"},{"id":2326,"text":"Probably only so-so."},{"id":2327,"text":"He said, \"Get Delmarre's place and contact his assistant."},{"id":2328,"text":"If the assistant is not there, locate him wherever he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master.\"\r\n\r\nAs the robot turned to go, Baley called after it, \"Wait!"},{"id":2329,"text":"What time is it at the Delmarre workplace?\"\r\n\r\n\"About 0630, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Baley felt annoyance at a world that made itself victim of the coming and going of a sun."},{"id":2330,"text":"It was what came of living on bare planetary surface."},{"id":2331,"text":"He thought fugitively of Earth, then tore his mind away."},{"id":2332,"text":"While he kept firmly to the matter in hand, he managed well."},{"id":2333,"text":"Slipping into homesickness would ruin him."},{"id":2334,"text":"He said, \"Call the assistant, anyway, boy, and tell him it's government business-and have one 'of the other boys bring something to eat."},{"id":2335,"text":"A sandwich and a glass of milk will do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe chewed thoughtfully at the sandwich, which contained a kind of smoked meat, and with half his mind thought that Daneel Olivaw would certainly consider every article of food suspect after what had happened to Gruer."},{"id":2336,"text":"And Daneel might be right, too."},{"id":2337,"text":"He finished the sandwich without ill effects, however (immediate ill effects, at any rate), and sipped at the milk."},{"id":2338,"text":"He had not learned from Quemot what he had come to learn, but he had learned some-\r\n\r\nthing."},{"id":2339,"text":"As he sorted it out in his mind, it seemed he had learned a good deal."},{"id":2340,"text":"Little about the murder, to be sure, but more about the larger matter."},{"id":2341,"text":"The robot returned. \"The assistant will accept contact, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good."},{"id":2342,"text":"Was there any trouble about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The assistant was asleep, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awake now, though?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, master.\"\r\n\r\nThe assistant was facing him suddenly, sitting up in bed and wearing an expression of sullen resentment."},{"id":2343,"text":"Baley reared back as though a force-barrier had been raised before him without warning."},{"id":2344,"text":"Once again a piece of vital information had been withheld from him."},{"id":2345,"text":"Once again he had not asked the right questions."},{"id":2346,"text":"No one had thought to tell him that Rikaine Delmarre's assistant was a woman."},{"id":2347,"text":"Her hair was a trifle darker than ordinary Spacer bronze and there was a quantity of it, at the moment in disorder."},{"id":2348,"text":"Her face was oval, her nose a trifle bulbous, and her chin large."},{"id":2349,"text":"She scratched slowly at her side just above the waist and Baley hoped the sheet would remain in position."},{"id":2350,"text":"He remembered Gladia's free attitude toward what was permitted while viewing."},{"id":2351,"text":"Baley felt a sardonic amusement at his own disillusion at that moment."},{"id":2352,"text":"Earthmen assumed, somehow, that all Spacer women were beautiful, and certainly Gladia had reinforced that assumption."},{"id":2353,"text":"This one, though, was plain even by Earthly standards."},{"id":2354,"text":"It therefore surprised Baley that he found her contralto attractive when she said, \"See here, do you know what time it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said Baley, \"but since I will be seeing you, I felt I should warn you.\r\n\r\n\"Seeing me?"},{"id":2355,"text":"Skies above--\" Her eyes grew wide and she put a hand to her chin. (She wore a ring on one finger, the first item of personal adornment Baley had yet seen on Solaria.) \"Wait, you're not my new assistant, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No."},{"id":2356,"text":"Nothing like that."},{"id":2357,"text":"I'm here to investigate the death of Rikaine Delmarre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh?"},{"id":2358,"text":"Well, investigate, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kiorissa Cantoro.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how long have you been working with Dr."},{"id":2359,"text":"Delmarre?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three years.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assume you're now at the place of business.\" (Baley felt uncomfortable at that noncommittal phrase, but he did not know what to call a place where a fetal engineer worked.)\r\n\r\n\"If you mean, am I at the farm?\" said Kiorissa discontentedly, \"I certainly am."},{"id":2360,"text":"I haven't left it since the old man was done in, and I won't leave it, looks like, till an assistant is assigned me."},{"id":2361,"text":"Can you arrange that, by the way?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, ma'am."},{"id":2362,"text":"I have no influence with anyone here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thought I'd ask.\"\r\n\r\nKiorissa pulled off the sheet and climbed out of bed without any self-consciousness."},{"id":2363,"text":"She was wearing a one-piece sleeping suit and her hand went to the notch of the seam, whereit ended at the neck."},{"id":2364,"text":"Baley said hurriedly, \"Just one moment."},{"id":2365,"text":"If you'll agree to see me, that will end my business with you for now and you may dress in privacy.\"\r\n\r\n\"In privacy?\" She put out her lower lip and stared at Baley curiously. \"You're finicky, aren't you?"},{"id":2366,"text":"Like the boss.\"\r\n\r\n'Will you see me?"},{"id":2367,"text":"I would like to look over the farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't get this business about seeing, but if you want to view the farm I'll tour you."},{"id":2368,"text":"If you'll give me a chance to wash and take care of a few things and wake up a little, I'll enjoy the break in routine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to view anything."},{"id":2369,"text":"I want to see.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman cocked her head to one side and her keen look had something of professional interest

no more."},{"id":2475,"text":"And the boss was skillful enough about it so that usually the robot didn't need more than a routine readjustment afterward.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about you?"},{"id":2476,"text":"Do you get out among the children?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I have to sometimes."},{"id":2477,"text":"I'm not like the boss."},{"id":2478,"text":"Maybe someday I'll be able to

wouldn't bother me.\"\r\n\r\nShe shrugged and stared at him with amusement. \"Earthinan!\"\r\n\r\nShe walked on again. \"What's all this about, anyway?"},{"id":2483,"text":"You'll have to end up with Gladia Delmarre as murderess."},{"id":2484,"text":"You'll have to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not quite sure of that,\" said Baley.\r\n\r\n\"How could you be anything else but sure?"},{"id":2485,"text":"Who else

Baley."},{"id":2486,"text":"She laughed."},{"id":2487,"text":"The laughter grew and fed on itself till she was gasping for breath and her plump face had reddened almost to purple."},{"id":2488,"text":"She leaned against the wall and gasped for breath.\r\n\r\n\"No, don't come-closer,\" she begged. \"I'm all right.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said gravely, \"Is the possibility that

said, \"A difference in degree.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suggest that a difference in degree is all that is necessary."},{"id":2496,"text":"The habit of seeing children makes it possible to endure seeing Delmarre just long enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would like to point out, Mr."},{"id":2497,"text":"Baley,\" said Klorissa, no longer ap\r\n\r\npearing the least amused, \"that it doesn't matter a speck what I can

instinct?"},{"id":2589,"text":"But then, what if it is?"},{"id":2590,"text":"Skies above, a child has an instinctive fear of falling, but adults can be trained to work in high places even where there is constant danger of fabling."},{"id":2591,"text":"Haven't you ever seen gymnastic exhibitions on high wires?"},{"id":2592,"text":"There are some worlds where people live in tall buildings."},{"id":2593,"text":"And children have instinctive fear of loud noises, too, but are you afraid of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not within reason,\" said Baley.\r\n\r\n\"I'm willing to bet that Earth people couldn't sleep if things were really quiet."},{"id":2594,"text":"Skies above, there isn't an instinct around that can't give way to a good, persistent education."},{"id":2595,"text":"Not in human beings, where instincts are weak anyway."},{"id":2596,"text":"In fact, if you go about it right, education gets easier with each generation."},{"id":2597,"text":"It's a matter of evolution.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"How is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see?"},{"id":2598,"text":"Each individual repeats his own evolutionary his-\r\n\r\ntory as he develops."},{"id":2599,"text":"Those fetuses back there have gills and a tail for a time."},{"id":2600,"text":"Can't skip those steps."},{"id":2601,"text":"The youngster has to go through the social-animal stage in the same way."},{"id":2602,"text":"But just as a fetus can get through in one month a stage that evolution took a hundred million years to get through, so our children can hurry through the socialanimal stage."},{"id":2603,"text":"Dr."},{"id":2604,"text":"Delmarre was of the opinion that with the generations, we'd get through that stage faster and faster.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that so?\"\r\n\r\n\"In three thousand years, he estimated, at the present rate of progress, we'd have children who'd take to viewing at once."},{"id":2605,"text":"The boss had other notions, too."},{"id":2606,"text":"He was interested in improving robots to the point of making them capable of disciplining children without becoming mentally unstable."},{"id":2607,"text":"Why not?"},{"id":2608,"text":"Discipline today for a better life tomorrow is a true expression of First Law if robots could only be made to see it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have such robots been developed yet?\"\r\n\r\nKlorissa shook her head. \"I'm afraid not."},{"id":2609,"text":"Dr."},{"id":2610,"text":"Delmarre and Leebig had been working hard on some experimental models.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did Dr."},{"id":2611,"text":"Delmarre have some of the models sent out to his estate?"},{"id":2612,"text":"Was he a good enough roboticist to conduct tests himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes."},{"id":2613,"text":"He tested robots frequently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that he had a robot with him when he was murdered?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been told so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what kind of a model it was?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to ask Leebig."},{"id":2614,"text":"As I told you, he's the roboticist who worked with Dr."},{"id":2615,"text":"Delmarre.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know nothing about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you think of anything, let me know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will."},{"id":2616,"text":"And don't think new robot models are all that Dr."},{"id":2617,"text":"Delmarre was interested in."},{"id":2618,"text":"Dr."},{"id":2619,"text":"Delmarre used to say the time would come when unfertilized ova would be stored in banks at liquid-air temperatures and utilized for artificial insemination."},{"id":2620,"text":"In that way, eugenic principles could be truly applied and we could get rid of the last vestige of any need for seeing."},{"id":2621,"text":"I'm not sure that I quite go along with him so far, but he was a man of advanced notions; a very good Solarian.\"\r\n\r\nShe added quickly, \"Do you want to go outside?"},{"id":2622,"text":"The five-through-\r\n\r\neight group are encouraged to take part in outdoor play and you could see them in action.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said cautiously, \"I'll try that."},{"id":2623,"text":"I may have to come back inside on rather short notice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I forgot."},{"id":2624,"text":"Maybe you'd rather not go out at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\" Baley forced a smile. \"I'm trying to grow accustomed to the outdoors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wind was hard to bear."},{"id":2625,"text":"It made breathing difficult."},{"id":2626,"text":"It wasn't cold, in a direct physical sense, but the feel of it, the feel of his clothes moving against his body, gave Baley a kind of chill."},{"id":2627,"text":"His teeth chattered when he tried to talk and he had to force his words out in little bits."},{"id":2628,"text":"It hurt his eyes to look so far at a horizon so hazy green and blue and there was only limited relief when he looked at the pathway immediately before his toes."},{"id":2629,"text":"Above all, he avoided looking up at the empty blue, empty, that is, but for the piled-up white of occasional clouds and the glare of the naked sun."},{"id":2630,"text":"And yet he could fight off the urge to run, to return to enclosure."},{"id":2631,"text":"He passed a tree, following Klorissa by some ten paces, and he reached out a cautious hand to touch it."},{"id":2632,"text":"It was rough and hard to the touch."},{"id":2633,"text":"Frondy leaves moved and rustled overhead, but he did not raise his eyes to look at them."},{"id":2634,"text":"A living tree!"},{"id":2635,"text":"Klorissa called out. \"How do you feel?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can see a group of youngsters from here,\" she said. \"They're involved in some kind of game."},{"id":2636,"text":"The robots organize the games and see to it that the little animals don't kick each other's eyes out."},{"id":2637,"text":"With personal presence you can do just that, you know.\"\r\n\r\nBaley raised his eyes slowly, running his glance along the cement of the pathway out to the grass and down the slope, farther and farther out-very carefully-ready to snap back to his toes if he grew frightened-feeling with his eyes. ."},{"id":2638,"text":"There were the small figures of boys and girls racing madly about, uncaring that they raced at the very outer rim of a world with nothing but air and space above them."},{"id":2639,"text":"The glitter of an occasional robot moved nimbly among them."},{"id":2640,"text":"The noise of the children was a far-off incoherent squeaking in the air.\r\n\r\n\"They love it,\" said Kborissa. \"Pushing and pulling and squab\r\n\r\nbling and falling down and getting up and just generally contacting."},{"id":2641,"text":"Skies above!"},{"id":2642,"text":"How do children ever manage to grow up?\"\r\n\r\n'What are those older children doing?\" asked Baley."},{"id":2643,"text":"He pointed at a group of isolated youngsters standing to one side.\r\n\r\n\"They're viewing."},{"id":2644,"text":"They're not in a state of personal presence."},{"id":2645,"text":"By viewing, they can walk together, talk together, race together, play together."},{"id":2646,"text":"Anything except physical contact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do children go when they leave here?\"\r\n\r\n\"To estates of their own."},{"id":2647,"text":"The number of deaths is, on the average, equal to the number of graduations.\"\r\n\r\n\"To their parents' estates?\"\r\n\r\n\"Skies above, no!"},{"id":2648,"text":"It would be an amazing coincidence, wouldn't it, to have a parent die just as a child is of age."},{"id":2649,"text":"No, the children take any one that falls vacant."},{"id":2650,"text":"I don't know that any of them would be particularly happy, anyway, living in a mansion that once belonged to their parents, supposing, of course, they knew who their parents were.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't they?\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyebrows. \"Why should they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't parents visit their children here?\"\r\n\r\n\"What a mind you have."},{"id":2651,"text":"Why should they want to?\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"Do you mind if I clear up a point for myself?"},{"id":2652,"text":"Is it bad manners to ask a person if they have had children?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's an intimate question, wouldn't you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm hardened."},{"id":2653,"text":"Children are my business."},{"id":2654,"text":"Other people aren't.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"Have you any children?\"\r\n\r\nKlorissa's Adam's apple made a soft but clearly visible motion in her throat as she swallowed. \"I deserve that, I suppose."},{"id":2655,"text":"And you deserve an answer."},{"id":2656,"text":"I haven't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you married?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I have an estate of my own and I would be there but for the emergency here."},{"id":2657,"text":"I'm just not confident of being able to control all the robots if I'm not here in person.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned away unhappily, and then pointed. \"Now there's one of them gone tumbling and of course he's crying.\"\r\n\r\nA robot was running with great space-devouring strides."},{"id":2658,"text":"Kiorissa said, \"He'll be picked up and cuddled and if there's any\r\n\r\nreal damage, I'll be called in.\" She added nervously, \"I hope I don't have to be.\"\r\n\r\nBaley took a deep breath."},{"id":2659,"text":"He noted three trees forming a small triangle fifty feet to the left."},{"id":2660,"text":"He walked in that direction, the grass soft and loathsome under his shoes, disgusting in its softness (like walking through corrupting flesh, and he nearly retched at the thought)."},{"id":2661,"text":"He was among them, his back against one trunk."},{"id":2662,"text":"It was almost like being surrounded by imperfect walls."},{"id":2663,"text":"The sun was only a wavering series of glitters through the leaves, so disconnected as almost to be robbed of horror."},{"id":2664,"text":"Klorissa faced him from the path, then slowly shortened the distance by half.\r\n\r\n\"Mind if I stay here awhile?\" asked Baley.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead,\" said Kiorissa."},{"id":2665,"text":"Baley said, \"Once the youngsters graduate out of the farm, how do you get them to court one another?\"\r\n\r\n\"Court?\"\r\n\r\n\"Get to know one another,\" said Baley, vaguely wondering how the thought could be expressed safely, \"so they can marry.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not their problem,\" said Klorissa. \"They're matched by gene analysis, usually when they are quite young."},{"id":2666,"text":"That's the sensible way, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they always willing?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be married?"},{"id":2667,"text":"They never are!"},{"id":2668,"text":"It's a very traumatic process."},{"id":2669,"text":"At first they have to grow accustomed to one another, and a little bit of seeing each day, once the initial queasiness is gone, can do wonders.\"\r\n\r\n\"What if they just don't like their partner?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?"},{"id":2670,"text":"If the gene analysis indicates a partnership what difference does it--\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" said Baley hastily."},{"id":2671,"text":"He thought of Earth and sighed."},{"id":2672,"text":"Klorissa said, \"Is there anything else you would like to know?\"\r\n\r\nBaley wondered if there were anything to be gained from a longer stay."},{"id":2673,"text":"He would not be sorry to be done with Klorissa and fetal engineering so that he might pass on to the next stage."},{"id":2674,"text":"He had opened his mouth to say as much, when Klorissa called out at some object far off, \"You, child, you there!"},{"id":2675,"text":"What are you doing?\" Then, over her shoulder: \"Earthman!"},{"id":2676,"text":"Baley!"},{"id":2677,"text":"Watch out!"},{"id":2678,"text":"Watch out!\"\r\n\r\nBaley scarcely heard her."},{"id":2679,"text":"He responded to the note of urgency in her voice."},{"id":2680,"text":"The nervous effort that held his emotions taut snapped wide and he flamed into panic."},{"id":2681,"text":"All the terror of the open air and the endless vault of heaven broke in upon him."},{"id":2682,"text":"Baley gibbered."},{"id":2683,"text":"He heard himself mouth meaningless sounds and felt himself fall to his knees and slowly roll over to his side as though he were watching the process from a distance."},{"id":2684,"text":"Also from a distance he heard the sighing hum piercing the air above him and ending with a sharp thwack."},{"id":2685,"text":"Baley closed his eyes and his fingers clutched a thin tree root that skimmed the surface of the ground and his nails burrowed into dirt."},{"id":2686,"text":"He opened his eyes (it must only have been moments after)."},{"id":2687,"text":"Kbrissa was scolding sharply at a youngster who remained at a distance."},{"id":2688,"text":"A robot, silent, stood closer to Klorissa."},{"id":2689,"text":"Baley had only time to notice the youngster held a stringed object in his hand before his eyes sheered away."},{"id":2690,"text":"Breathing heavily, Baley struggled to his feet."},{"id":2691,"text":"He stared at the shaft of glistening metal that remained in the trunk of the tree against which he had been standing."},{"id":2692,"text":"He pulled at it and it came out readily."},{"id":2693,"text":"It had not penetrated far."},{"id":2694,"text":"He looked at the point but did not touch it."},{"id":2695,"text":"It was blunted, but it would have sufficed to tear his skin had he not dropped when he did."},{"id":2696,"text":"It took him two tries to get his legs moving."},{"id":2697,"text":"He took a step toward Klorissa and called, \"You."},{"id":2698,"text":"Youngster.\"\r\n\r\nKlorissa turned, her face flushed."},{"id":2699,"text":"She said, \"It was an accident."},{"id":2700,"text":"Are you hurt?\"\r\n\r\nNo!"},{"id":2701,"text":"What is this thing?\r\n\r\n\"It's an arrow."},{"id":2702,"text":"It is fired by a bow, which makes a taut string do the work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like this,\" called the youngster impudently, and he shot another arrow into the air, then burst out laughing."},{"id":2703,"text":"He had light hair and a lithe body."},{"id":2704,"text":"Klorissa said, \"You will be disciplined."},{"id":2705,"text":"Now leave!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait, wait,\" cried Baley."},{"id":2706,"text":"He rubbed his knee where a rock had

among the boys using viewing only."},{"id":2711,"text":"Now I'm afraid some of the boys will aim at robots."},{"id":2712,"text":"It amuses them and it doesn't hurt the robots."},{"id":2713,"text":"I'm the only adult human on the estate and when the boy saw you, he must have assumed you were a robot.\"\r\n\r\nBaley listened."},{"id":2714,"text":"His mind was clearing, and the natural dourness of his long face intensified."},{"id":2715,"text":"He said, \"Bik, did you think I was a robot?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the youngster. \"You're an Earthman.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right."},{"id":2716,"text":"Go now.\"\r\n\r\nBik turned and raced off whistling."},{"id":2717,"text":"Baley turned to the robot. \"You!"},{"id":2718,"text":"How did the youngster know I was an Earthman, or weren't you with him when

Earthman?\"\r\n\r\n\"An inferior sort of human that ought not to be allowed on Solana because he breeds disease, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who told you that, boy?\"\r\n\r\nThe robot maintained silence."},{"id":2720,"text":"Baley said, \"Do you know who told you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not, master."},{"id":2721,"text":"It is in my memory store.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you told the boy I was a disease-breeding inferior and he immediately shot at me."},{"id":2722,"text":"Why didn't you stop him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would have, master."},{"id":2723,"text":"I would not have allowed harm to come to a human, even an Earthman."},{"id":2724,"text":"He moved too quickly and I was not fast enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you thought I was just an Earthman, not completely a human, and hesitated a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, master.\"\r\n\r\nIt was said with quiet calm, but Baley's lips quirked grimly."},{"id":2725,"text":"The robot might deny it in all faith, but Baley felt that was exactly the factor involved."},{"id":2726,"text":"Baley said, \"What were you doing with the boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was carrying his arrows, master.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I see them?\"\r\n\r\nHe held out his hand."},{"id":2727,"text":"The robot approached and delivered a dozen of them."},{"id":2728,"text":"Baley put the original arrow, the one that had hit the tree, carefully at his feet, and looked the others over one by one."},{"id":2729,"text":"He handed them back and lifted the original arrow again."},{"id":2730,"text":"He said, 'Why did you give this particular arrow to the boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"No reason, master."},{"id":2731,"text":"He had asked for an arrow some time earlier\r\n\r\nand this was the one my hand touched first."},{"id":2732,"text":"He looked about for a\r\n\r\ntarget, then

randomly, master.\"\r\n\r\nThe Earthman looked through the gap between two trees through which the arrow had hurled itself toward its mark."},{"id":2737,"text":"He said, \"Would it happen, by any chance, that this youngster, Bik, was the best archer you have here?\"\r\n\r\nThe robot bent his head. \"He is the best, master.\"\r\n\r\nKlorissa gaped. \"How did you ever come to guess

why."},{"id":2744,"text":"The question is, who?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one.\"\r\n\r\nBaley felt the dizziness returning and he grew savage."},{"id":2745,"text":"He threw the arrow at her and she eyed the spot

good."},{"id":2894,"text":"Isn't that the theory?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, the future good!\" Leebig's eyes glowed with passion and he seemed to grow less conscious of his listener and correspondingly more talkative. \"A simple concept, you think."},{"id":2895,"text":"How many human beings are willing to accept a trifling inconvenience for the sake of a large future good?"},{"id":2896,"text":"How long

care.\"\r\n\r\nBaley nodded."},{"id":2959,"text":"He said, \"Let me quote the First Law.\"\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely need that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, but let me quote it, anyway: A robot may not harm a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now when I first landed on Solaria, I was driven to the estate assigned for my use in a ground-car."},{"id":2960,"text":"The ground-car was a specially enclosed job designed to protect me from exposure to open space."},{"id":2961,"text":"As an Earthman--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know about that,\"

knowledge--\"\r\n\r\nBaley leaned forward in his chair. \"Ah!"},{"id":2969,"text":"We have it."},{"id":2970,"text":"Now let's recite the First Law as it should be stated: A robot may do nothing that, to its knowledge, will harm a human being; nor, through inaction, knowingly allow a human being to come to harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is all understood.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not by ordinary men."},{"id":2971,"text":"Otherwise, ordinary men would realize robots could commit murder.\"\r\n\r\nLeebig was white. \"Mad!"},{"id":2972,"text":"Lunacy!\"\r\n\r\nBaley stared at his finger ends. \"A

to do so."},{"id":2974,"text":"And a second robot may perform an innocent task, also, I suppose; one that also can have no damaging effect on a human being?"},{"id":2975,"text":"If ordered to do so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And what if the two innocent tasks, each completely innocent, completely, amount to murder when added together?\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Leebig's face puckered into a scowl.\r\n\r\n\"I want your expert opinion on the matter,\" said Baley. \"I'll set you a hypothetical case."},{"id":2976,"text":"Suppose a man says to a robot, 'Place a small quantity of this liquid

know the effect, the mixture will be poured out."},{"id":2980,"text":"After you have performed this action, forget you have done so.\"\r\n\r\nLeebig, still scowling, said nothing."},{"id":2981,"text":"Baley said, \"If I had told the robot to add a mysterious liquid to milk and then offer it to a man, First Law would force it to ask, 'What is the nature of the liquid?"},{"id":2982,"text":"Will it harm a man?'

out."},{"id":2984,"text":"First Law is not involved."},{"id":2985,"text":"Won't the robot do as it is told?\"\r\n\r\nLeebig glared."},{"id":2986,"text":"Baley said, \"Now a second robot has poured out the milk in the first place and is unaware that the milk has been tampered with."},{"id":2987,"text":"In all innocence, it offers the milk to a man and the man dies.\"\r\n\r\nLeebig cried out, \"No!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?"},{"id":2988,"text":"Both actions are innocent in themselves."},{"id":2989,"text":"Only together are they murder."},{"id":2990,"text":"Do you deny that that sort of thing can happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"The murderer would be the man who gave the order,\" cried Leebig.\r\n\r\n\"If you want to be philosophical, yes."},{"id":2991,"text":"The robots would have been the immediate murderers, though, the instruments of murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"No man would give such orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"A man would."},{"id":2992,"text":"A man has."},{"id":2993,"text":"It was exactly in this way that the

expert, Dr."},{"id":3004,"text":"Leebig."},{"id":3005,"text":"Is it possible?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Leebig, haunted and harried, said, \"Yes,\" in a voice so low that Baley scarcely heard him."},{"id":3006,"text":"Baley said, \"Very well, then."},{"id":3007,"text":"So much for the First Law.\"\r\n\r\nLeebig stared at Baley and his drooping eyelid winked once or twice in a slow

air."},{"id":3009,"text":"Palms turned downward and rested on knees and only then did the fingers relax."},{"id":3010,"text":"Baley watched it all in abstraction."},{"id":3011,"text":"Leebig said,

of example."},{"id":3016,"text":"A Solarian would be much more subtle and do much better."},{"id":3017,"text":"I'm sure of that.\"\r\n\r\nLeebig might not have been listening."},{"id":3018,"text":"He said loudly, \"If a robot\r\n\r\ncan be manipulated into doing harm to a man, it means only that we must extend the powers of the positronic brain."},{"id":3019,"text":"One might say we ought to make the human better."},{"id":3020,"text":"That is impossible, so we will make the robot more foolproof.\r\n\r\n\"We advance continuously."},{"id":3021,"text":"Our robots are more varied, more

controls when a positronic brain can be built into the controls itself?"},{"id":3024,"text":"That's specialization, but we can generalize, also."},{"id":3025,"text":"Why not a robot with replaceable and interchangeable limbs."},{"id":3026,"text":"Eh?"},{"id":3027,"text":"Why not?"},{"id":3028,"text":"If we-\"\r\n\r\nBaley interrupted. \"Are you the only roboticist on Solaria?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be

large factory and maintenance shop on my estate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do robots require much in the way of repair, by the way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very little.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does that mean that robot repair is an undeveloped science?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.\" Leebig said that stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"What about the robot that was at the scene of Dr."},{"id":3036,"text":"Delmarre's murder?\"\r\n\r\nLeebig looked away, and his eyebrows drew together as though a painful thought were being barred entrance to his mind. \"It was a complete loss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really complete?"},{"id":3037,"text":"Could it answer any questions at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"None at all."},{"id":3038,"text":"It was absolutely useless."},{"id":3039,"text":"Its positronic brain was completely short-circuited."},{"id":3040,"text":"Not one pathway

might have ordered it, for instance, to suspend all operations while he checked one particular circuit element."},{"id":3047,"text":"If someone whom neither Dr."},{"id":3048,"text":"Delmarre nor the

freezing order."},{"id":3050,"text":"The length of the interval would depend on the nature of the attack and the nature of Dr."},{"id":3051,"text":"Delmarre's freezing order."},{"id":3052,"text":"I could invent a dozen other ways of explaining why the robot was unable to prevent the murder."},{"id":3053,"text":"Being unable to do so was a First Law violation, however, and that was sufficient to blast every positronic pathway in the robot's mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if the robot was physically unable to prevent the murder, was it responsible?"},{"id":3054,"text":"Does the First Law ask impossibilities?\"\r\n\r\nLeebig shrugged. \"The First Law, despite your attempts to make little of it, protects humanity with every atom of possible force."},{"id":3055,"text":"It allows no excuses."},{"id":3056,"text":"If the First Law is broken, the robot is ruined.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a universal rule, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"As universal as robots.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"Then I've learned something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then learn something else."},{"id":3057,"text":"Your theory of murder by a series of robotic actions, each innocent in itself, will not help you in the case of Dr."},{"id":3058,"text":"Delmarre's death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"The death was not by poisoning, but by bludgeoning."},{"id":3059,"text":"Something had to hold the bludgeon, and that had to be a human arm."},{"id":3060,"text":"No robot could swing a club and smash a skull.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" said Baley, \"a robot were to push an innocent button which dropped a booby-trap weight on

was responsible for one crime, she must be responsible for the second attempt, also.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes."},{"id":3069,"text":"You must be right.\" His voice gained assurance. \"No doubt of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody else could get close enough to Dr."},{"id":3070,"text":"Delmarre to kill him."},{"id":3071,"text":"He allowed personal presence no more than I did, except that he made an exception in favor of his wife, and I make no exceptions."},{"id":3072,"text":"The wiser I.\" The roboticist laughed harshly.\r\n\r\n\"I believe you knew her,\" said Baley abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her."},{"id":3073,"text":"We are discussing only one 'her.'

opened the neck-seam of his garment for an inch downward, leaving more freedom to breathe.\r\n\r\n\"Gladia herself did."},{"id":3076,"text":"You two went for walks.\"\r\n\r\n\"So?"},{"id":3077,"text":"We were neighbors."},{"id":3078,"text":"It is a common thing to do."},{"id":3079,"text":"She seemed a pleasant person.\"\r\n\r\n\"You approved of her,

the question could be asked.\r\n\r\n\"And she talked robotics too?\"\r\n\r\n\"She knew nothing about robotics."},{"id":3080,"text":"Ignorant!"},{"id":3081,"text":"But she listened."},{"id":3082,"text":"She has some sort of field-force rigmarole she plays with; field coloring, she calls it."},{"id":3083,"text":"I have no patience with that, but I listened.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this without personal presence?\" Leebig looked revolted and did not answer."},{"id":3084,"text":"Baley tried again, 'Were you attracted to her?\" \"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you find her attractive?"},{"id":3085,"text":"Physically?\"\r\n\r\nEven Leebig's bad eyelid lifted and his lips quivered. \"Filthy animal,\" he muttered.\r\n\r\n\"Let me put it this way, then."},{"id":3086,"text":"When did you cease finding Gladia pleasant?"},{"id":3087,"text":"You used that word yourself, if you remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"You said you found her pleasant."},{"id":3088,"text":"Now you believe she murdered her husband."},{"id":3089,"text":"That isn't the mark of a pleasant person.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was mistaken about her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you decided you were mistaken before she killed her husband, if she did so."},{"id":3090,"text":"You stopped walking with her some time before the murder."},{"id":3091,"text":"Why?\"\r\n\r\nLeebig said, \"Is that important?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything is important till proven otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look, if you want information from me as a roboticist, ask it."},{"id":3092,"text":"I won't answer personal questions.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"You were closely associated with both the murdered man and the chief suspect."},{"id":3093,"text":"Don't you see that personal questions are unavoidable?"},{"id":3094,"text":"Why did you stop walking with Gladia?\"\r\n\r\nLeebig snapped, \"There came a time when I ran out of things to say; when I was too busy; when I found no reason to continue the walks.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you no longer found her pleasant, in other words.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right."},{"id":3095,"text":"Put it so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why was she no longer pleasant?\"\r\n\r\nLeebig shouted, \"I have no reason.\"\r\n\r\nBaley ignored the other's excitement. \"You are still someone who has known Gladia well."},{"id":3096,"text":"What could her motive be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her motive?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one has suggested any motive for the murder."},{"id":3097,"text":"Surely Gladia wouldn't commit murder without a motive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Galaxy!\" Leebig leaned his head back as though to laugh, but didn't. \"No one told you?"},{"id":3098,"text":"Well, perhaps no one knew."},{"id":3099,"text":"I knew, though."},{"id":3100,"text":"She told me."},{"id":3101,"text":"She told me frequently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Told you what, Dr."},{"id":3102,"text":"Leebig?\"\r\n\r\n'Why, that she quarreled with her husband."},{"id":3103,"text":"Quarreled bitterly and frequently."},{"id":3104,"text":"She hated him, Earthman."},{"id":3105,"text":"Didn't anyone tell you that?"},{"id":3106,"text":"Didn't she tell you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaley took it between the eyes and tried not to show it."},{"id":3107,"text":"Presumably, living as they did, Solarians considered one another's private lives to be sacrosanct."},{"id":3108,"text":"Questions concerning marriage and children were in bad taste."},{"id":3109,"text":"He supposed then that chronic quarreling could exist between husband and wife and be a matter into which curiosity was equally forbidden."},{"id":3110,"text":"But even when murder had been committed?"},{"id":3111,"text":"Would no one commit the social crime of asking the suspect if she quarreled with her

was almost as though he were in his own element."},{"id":3122,"text":"He wasn't even thinking of Earth or of Jessie."},{"id":3123,"text":"He had been away from Earth only a matter of weeks, yet it

mixed apprehension and anticipation?"},{"id":3129,"text":"Would she endure it?"},{"id":3130,"text":"he wondered."},{"id":3131,"text":"Or would she slip away after a few moments of seeing, begging off as Quemot had done?"},{"id":3132,"text":"She stood at the other end of a long room when he entered."},{"id":3133,"text":"She might almost have been an impressionistic representation of herself, she was reduced so to essentials."},{"id":3134,"text":"Her lips were faintly red, her eyebrows lightly penciled, her earlobes faintly blue, and, except for that, her face was untouched."},{"id":3135,"text":"She looked pale, a little frightened, and very young."},{"id":3136,"text":"Her brown-blond hair was drawn back, and her gray-blue eyes were somehow shy."},{"id":3137,"text":"Her dress was a blue so dark as to be almost black, with a thin white edging curling down each side."},{"id":3138,"text":"She wore long sleeves, white gloves, and flat-heeled shoes."},{"id":3139,"text":"Not an inch of skin showed anywhere but in her face."},{"id":3140,"text":"Even her neck was covered by a kind of unobtrusive ruching."},{"id":3141,"text":"Baley stopped where he was. \"Is this close enough, Gladia?\"\r\n\r\nShe was breathing with shallow quickness."},{"id":3142,"text":"She said, \"I had forgotten what to expect really."},{"id":3143,"text":"It's just like viewing, isn't it?"},{"id":3144,"text":"I mean, if you don't think of it as seeing.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"It's all quite normal to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, on Earth.\" She closed her eyes.

novel."},{"id":3150,"text":"It just seems like a multiview.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do people ever kiss in novels?\"\r\n\r\nShe flushed painfully. \"I don't read that kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never?\"\r\n\r\n'Well-there are always a few dirty films around, you know, and sometimes, just out of curiosity-- It's sickening, really.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it?\"\r\n\r\nShe said with sudden animation, \"But Earth is so

them."},{"id":3167,"text":"At that, it was less than a third the distance Kiorissa had demanded."},{"id":3168,"text":"They entered a room that burst with light."},{"id":3169,"text":"It glowed in every corner and every color."},{"id":3170,"text":"Gladia looked pleased, proprietary."},{"id":3171,"text":"She looked up at Baley, eyes anticipating."},{"id":3172,"text":"Baley's response must have been what she expected, though he said nothing."},{"id":3173,"text":"He turned slowly, trying to make out what he saw, for it was light only, no material object at all."},{"id":3174,"text":"The gobbets of light sat on embracing pedestals."},{"id":3175,"text":"They were liv-\r\n\r\ning geometry, lines and curves of color, entwined into a coalescing whole yet maintaining distinct identities."},{"id":3176,"text":"No two."},{"id":3177,"text":"specimens were even remotely alike."},{"id":3178,"text":"Baley groped for appropriate words and said, \"Is it supposed to mean anything?\"\r\n\r\nGladia laughed in her pleasant contralto. \"It means whatever you like it to mean."},{"id":3179,"text":"They're just light-forms that might make you feel angry or happy or curious or whatever I felt when I constructed one."},{"id":3180,"text":"I could make one for you, a kind of portrait."},{"id":3181,"text":"It might not be very good, though, because I would just be improvising quickly.\"\r\n\r\n'Would you?"},{"id":3182,"text":"I would be very interested.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" she said, and half-ran to a light-figure in one corner, passing within inches of him as she did so."},{"id":3183,"text":"She did not seem to notice."},{"id":3184,"text":"She touched something on the pedestal of the light-figure and the glory above died without a flicker."},{"id":3185,"text":"Baley gasped and said, \"Don't do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right."},{"id":3186,"text":"I was tired of it, anyway."},{"id":3187,"text":"I'll just fade the others temporarily so they don't distract me.\" She opened a panel along one featureless wall and moved a rheostat."},{"id":3188,"text":"The colors faded to something scarcely visible."},{"id":3189,"text":"Baley said, \"Don't you have a robot to do this?"},{"id":3190,"text":"Closing contacts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shush, now,\" she said impatiently. \"I don't keep robots in here."},{"id":3191,"text":"This is -me.\" She looked at him, frowning. \"I don't know you well enough."},{"id":3192,"text":"That's the trouble.\"\r\n\r\nShe wasn't looking at the pedestal, but her fingers rested lightly on its smooth upper surface."},{"id":3193,"text":"All ten fingers were curved, tense, waiting."},{"id":3194,"text":"One finger moved, describing a half curve over smoothness."},{"id":3195,"text":"A bar of deep yellow light grew and slanted obliquely across the air above."},{"id":3196,"text":"The finger inched backward a fraction and the light grew slightly less deep in shade."},{"id":3197,"text":"She looked at it momentarily. \"I suppose that's it."},{"id":3198,"text":"A kind of strength without weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jehoshaphat,\" said Baley.\r\n\r\n\"Are you offended?\" Her fingers lifted and the yellow slant of light remained solitary and stationary.\r\n\r\n\"No, not at all."},{"id":3199,"text":"But what is it?"},{"id":3200,"text":"How do you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's hard to explain,\" said Glaclia, looking at the pedestal\r\n\r\nthoughtfully, \"considering I don't really understand it myself."},{"id":3201,"text":"It's a kind of optical illusion, I've been told."},{"id":3202,"text":"We set up force-fields at different energy levels."},{"id":3203,"text":"They're extrusions of hyperspace, really, and don't have the properties of ordinary space at all."},{"id":3204,"text":"Depending on the energy level, the human eye sees light of different shades."},{"id":3205,"text":"The shapes and colors are controlled by the warmth of my fingers against appropriate spots on the pedestal."},{"id":3206,"text":"There are all sorts of controls inside each pedestal.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean if I were to put my finger there-\" Baley advanced and Gladia made way for him."},{"id":3207,"text":"He put a hesitant forefinger down upon the pedestal and felt a soft throbbing.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead."},{"id":3208,"text":"Move your finger, Elijah,\" said Gladia."},{"id":3209,"text":"Baley did so and a dirty-gray jag of light lifted upward, skewing the yellow light."},{"id":3210,"text":"Baley withdrew his finger sharply and Gladia laughed and then was instantly contrite.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't laugh,\" she said. \"It's really very hard to do, even for people who've tried a long time.\" Her own hand moved lightly and too quickly for Baley to follow and the monstrosity he had set up disappeared, leaving the yellow light in isolation again.\r\n\r\n\"How did you learn to do this?\" asked Baley.\r\n\r\n\"I just kept on trying."},{"id":3211,"text":"It's a new art form, you know, and only one or two really know how--\"\r\n\r\n\"And you're the best,\" said Baley somberly. \"On Solaria everyone is either the only or the best or both.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't laugh."},{"id":3212,"text":"I've had some of my pedestals on display."},{"id":3213,"text":"I've given shows.\" Her chin lifted."},{"id":3214,"text":"There was no mistaking her pride."},{"id":3215,"text":"She continued, \"Let me go on with your portrait.\" Her fingers moved again."},{"id":3216,"text":"There were few curves in the light-form that grew under her ministrations."},{"id":3217,"text":"It was all sharp angles."},{"id":3218,"text":"And the dominant color was blue.\r\n\r\n\"That's Earth, somehow,\" said Gladia, biting her lower lip. \"I always think of Earth as blue."},{"id":3219,"text":"All those people and seeing, seeing, seeing."},{"id":3220,"text":"Viewing is more rose."},{"id":3221,"text":"How does it seem to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jehoshaphat, I can't picture things as colors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you?\" she asked abstractedly. \"Now you say 'Jehoshaphat' sometimes and that's just a little blob of violet."},{"id":3222,"text":"A little sharp blob because it usually comes out ping, like that.\" And the little blob was there, glowing just off-center.\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" she said, \"I can finish it like this.\" And a flat, luster-\r\n\r\nless hollow cube of slate gray sprang up to enclose everything."},{"id":3223,"text":"The light within shone through it, but dimmer; imprisoned, somehow."},{"id":3224,"text":"Baley felt a sadness at it, as though it were something enclosing him, keeping him from something he wanted."},{"id":3225,"text":"He said, 'What's that last?\"\r\n\r\nGladia said, \"Why, the walls about you."},{"id":3226,"text":"That's what's most in you, the way you can't go outside, the way you have to be inside."},{"id":3227,"text":"You are inside there."},{"id":3228,"text":"Don't you see?\"\r\n\r\nBaley saw and somehow he disapproved."},{"id":3229,"text":"He said, \"Those walls aren't permanent."},{"id":3230,"text":"I've been out today.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have?"},{"id":3231,"text":"Did you mind?\"\r\n\r\nHe could not resist a counterdig. \"The way you mind seeing me."},{"id":3232,"text":"You don't like it but you can stand it.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him thoughtfully. \"Do you want to come out now?"},{"id":3233,"text":"With me?"},{"id":3234,"text":"For a walk?\"\r\n\r\nIt was Baley's impulse to say: Jehoshaphat, no."},{"id":3235,"text":"She said, \"I've never walked with anyone, seeing."},{"id":3236,"text":"It's still daytime, and it's pleasant weather.\"\r\n\r\nBaley looked at his abstractionist portrait and said, \"If I go, will you take away the gray?\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled and said, \"I'll see how you behave.\"\r\n\r\nThe structure of light remained as they left the room."},{"id":3237,"text":"It stayed behind, holding Baley's imprisoned soul fast in the gray of the Cities."},{"id":3238,"text":"Baley shivered slightly."},{"id":3239,"text":"Air moved against him and there was a chill to it."},{"id":3240,"text":"Gladia said, \"Are you cold?\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't like this before,\" muttered Baley.\r\n\r\n\"It's late in the day now, but it isn't really cold."},{"id":3241,"text":"Would you like a coat?"},{"id":3242,"text":"One of the robots could bring one in a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"No."},{"id":3243,"text":"It's all right.\" They stepped forward along a narrow paved path."},{"id":3244,"text":"He said, \"Is this where you used to walk with Dr."},{"id":3245,"text":"Leebig?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no."},{"id":3246,"text":"We walked way out among the fields, where you only see an occasional robot working and you can hear the animal sounds."},{"id":3247,"text":"You and I will stay near the house though, just in case.\"\r\n\r\n\"In case what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, in case you want to go in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or in case you get weary of seeing?\"\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't bother me,\" she said recklessly."},{"id":3248,"text":"There was the vague rustle of leaves above and an all-pervading yellowness and greenness."},{"id":3249,"text":"There were sharp, thin cries in the air about, plus a strident humming, and shadows, too."},{"id":3250,"text":"He was especially aware of the shadows."},{"id":3251,"text":"One of them stuck out before him, in shape like a man, that moved as he did in horrible mimicry."},{"id":3252,"text":"Baley had heard of shadows, of course, and he knew what they were, but in the pervasive indirect lighting of the Cities he had never been specifically aware of one."},{"id":3253,"text":"Behind him, he knew, was the Solarian sun."},{"id":3254,"text":"He took care not to look at it, but he knew it was there."},{"id":3255,"text":"Space was large, space was lonely, yet he found it drawing him."},{"id":3256,"text":"His mind pictured himself striding the surface of a world with thousands of miles and light-years of room all about him."},{"id":3257,"text":"Why should he find attraction in this thought of loneliness?"},{"id":3258,"text":"He didn't want loneliness."},{"id":3259,"text":"He wanted Earth and the warmth and companionship of the man-crammed Cities."},{"id":3260,"text":"The picture failed him."},{"id":3261,"text":"He tried to conjure up New York in his mind, all the noise and fullness of it, and found he could remain conscious only of the quiet, air-moving chill of the surface of Solaria."},{"id":3262,"text":"Without quite willing it Baley moved closer to Gladia until he was two feet away, then grew aware of her startled face.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said at once, and drew off."},{"id":3263,"text":"She gasped, \"It's all right."},{"id":3264,"text":"Won't you walk this way?"},{"id":3265,"text":"We have some flower beds you might like.\"\r\n\r\nThe direction she indicated lay away from the sun."},{"id":3266,"text":"Baley followed silently."},{"id":3267,"text":"Gladia said, \"Later in the year, it will be wonderful."},{"id":3268,"text":"In the warm weather I can run down to the lake and swim, or just run across the fields, run as fast as I can until I'm just glad to fall down and lie still.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked down at herself. \"But this is no costume for it."},{"id":3269,"text":"With all this on, I've got to walk."},{"id":3270,"text":"Sedately, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"How would you prefer to dress?\" asked Baley.\r\n\r\n\"Halter and shorts at the most,\" she cried, lifting her arms as though feeling the freedom of that in her imagination. \"Sometimes less."},{"id":3271,"text":"Sometimes just sandals so you can feel the air with every inch-- Oh, I'm sorry."},{"id":3272,"text":"I've offended you.\"\r\n\r\nBaley said, \"No."},{"id":3273,"text":"It's all right."},{"id":3274,"text":"Was that your costume when you went walking with Dr."},{"id":3275,"text":"Leebig?\"\r\n\r\n\"It varied."},{"id":3276,"text":"It depended on the weather."},{"id":3277,"text":"Sometimes I wore very little, but it was viewing, you know."},{"id":3278,"text":"You do understand, I hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand."},{"id":3279,"text":"What about Dr."},{"id":3280,"text":"Leebig, though?"},{"id":3281,"text":"Did he dress lightly too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jothan dress lightly?\" Gladia smiled flashingly. \"Oh no."},{"id":3282,"text":"He's very solemn, always.\" She twisted her face into a thin look of gravity and half winked, catching the very essence of Leebig and forcing a short grunt of appreciation out of Baley.\r\n\r\n\"This is the way he talks,\" she said. \"'My dear Gladia, in considering the effect of a first-order potential on positron flow-\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that what he talked to you about?"},{"id":3283,"text":"Robotics?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mostly."},{"id":3284,"text":"Oh, he takes it so seriously, you know."},{"id":3285,"text":"He was always trying to teach me about it."},{"id":3286,"text":"He never gave up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you learn anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not one thing."},{"id":3287,"text":"Nothing."},{"id":3288,"text":"It's just all a complete mix-up to me."},{"id":3289,"text":"He'd get angry with me sometimes, but when he'd scold, I'd dive into the water, if we were anywhere near the lake, and splash him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Splash him?"},{"id":3290,"text":"I thought you were viewing.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. \"You're such an Earthman."},{"id":3291,"text":"I'd splash where he was standing in his own room or on his own estate."},{"id":3292,"text":"The water couldn't touch him, but he would duck just the same."},{"id":3293,"text":"Look at that.\"\r\n\r\nBaley looked."},{"id":3294,"text":"They had circled a wooded patch and now came upon a clearing, centered about an ornamental pond."},{"id":3295,"text":"Small bricked walks penetrated the clearing and broke it up."},{"id":3296,"text":"Flowers grew in profusion and order."},{"id":3297,"text":"Baley knew them for flowers from book-films he had viewed."},{"id":3298,"text":"In a way the flowers were like the light-patterns that Gladia constructed and Baley imagined that she constructed them in the spirit of flowers."},{"id":3299,"text":"He touched one cautiously, then looked about."},{"id":3300,"text":"Reds and yellows predominated."},{"id":3301,"text":"In turning to look about Baley caught a glimpse of the sun."},{"id":3302,"text":"He said uneasily, \"The sun is low in the sky.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's late afternoon,\" called Gladia back to him."},{"id":3303,"text":"She had run toward the pond and was sitting on a stone bench at its edge. \"Come here,\" she shouted, waving. \"You can stand if you don't like to sit On stone.\"\r\n\r\nBaley advanced slowly. \"Does it get this low every day?\" and at once he was sorry he asked."},{"id":3304,"text":"If the planet rotated, the sun must be\r\n\r\nlow in the sky both mornings and afternoons."},{"id":3305,"text":"Only at midday could it be high."},{"id":3306,"text":"Telling himself this couldn't change a lifetime of pictured thought."},{"id":3307,"text":"He knew there was such a thing as night and had even experienced it, with a planet's whole thickness interposing safely between a man and the sun."},{"id":3308,"text":"He knew there were clouds and a protective grayness hiding the worst of outdoors."},{"id":3309,"text":"And still, when he thought of planetary surfaces, it was always a picture of a blaze of light with a sun high in the sky."},{"id":3310,"text":"He looked over his shoulder, just quickly enough to get a flash of sun, and wondered how far the house was if he should decide to return."},{"id":3311,"text":"Gladia was pointing to the other end of the stone bench."},{"id":3312,"text":"Baley said, \"That's pretty close to you, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\nShe spread out her little hands, palms up. \"I'm getting used to it."},{"id":3313,"text":"Really.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down, facing toward her to avoid the sun."},{"id":3314,"text":"She leaned over backward toward the water and pulled a small cup-shaped flower, yellow without and white-streaked within, not at all flamboyant."},{"id":3315,"text":"She said, \"This is a native plant."},{"id":3316,"text":"Most of the flowers here are from Earth originally.\"\r\n\r\nWater dripped from its severed stem as she extended it gingerly toward Baley."},{"id":3317,"text":"Baley reached for it as gingerly. \"You killed it,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It's only a flower."},{"id":3318,"text":"There are thousands more.\" Suddenly, before his fingers more than touched the yellow cup, she snatched it away, her eyes kindling. \"Or are you trying to imply I could kill a human being because I pulled a flower?\"\r\n\r\nBaley said in soft conciliation, \"I wasn't implying anything."},{"id":3319,"text":"May I see it?\"\r\n\r\nBaley didn't really want to touch it."},{"id":3320,"text":"It had grown in wet soil and there was still the effluvium of mud about it."},{"id":3321,"text":"How could these people, who were so careful in contact with Earthmen and even with one another, be so careless in their contact with ordinary dirt?"},{"id":3322,"text":"But he held the stalk between thumb and forefinger and looked at it."},{"id":3323,"text":"The cup was formed of several thin pieces of papery tissue, curving up from a common center."},{"id":3324,"text":"Within it was a white convex swelling, damp with liquid and fringed with dark hairs that trembled lightly in the wind."},{"id":3325,"text":"She said, \"Can you smell it?\"\r\n\r\nAt once Baley was aware of the odor that emanated from it."},{"id":3326,"text":"He leaned toward it and said, \"It smelislike a woman's perfume.\"\r\n\r\nGladia clapped her hands in delight. \"How like an Earthman."},{"id":3327,"text":"What you really mean is that a woman's perfume smells like that.\"\r\n\r\nBaley nodded ruefully."},{"id":3328,"text":"He was growing weary of the outdoors."},{"id":3329,"text":"The shadows were growing longer and the land was becoming somber."},{"id":3330,"text":"Yet he was determined not to give in."},{"id":3331,"text":"He wanted those gray walls of light that dimmed his portrait removed."},{"id":3332,"text":"It was quixotic, but there it was."},{"id":3333,"text":"Gladia took the flower from Baley, who let it go without reluctance."},{"id":3334,"text":"Slowly she pulled its petals apart."},{"id":3335,"text":"She said, \"I suppose every woman smells different.\"\r\n\r\n\"It depends on the perfume,\" said Baley indifferently.\r\n\r\n\"Imagine being close enough to tell."},{"id":3336,"text":"I don't wear perfume because no one is close enough."},{"id":3337,"text":"Except now."},{"id":3338,"text":"But I suppose you smell perfume often, all the time."},{"id":3339,"text":"On Earth, your wife is always with you, isn't she?\" She was concentrating very hard on the flower, frowning as she plucked it carefully to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"She's not always with me,\" said Baley. \"Not every minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"But most of the time."},{"id":3340,"text":"And whenever you want to--\"\r\n\r\nBaley said suddenly, \"Why did Dr."},{"id":3341,"text":"Leebig try so hard to teach you robotics, do you suppose?\"\r\n\r\nThe dismembered flower consisted now of a stalk and the inner swelling."},{"id":3342,"text":"Gladia twirled it between her fingers, then tossed it away, so that it floated for a moment on the surface of the pond. \"I think he wanted me to be his assistant,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Did he tell you so, Gladia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Toward the end, Elijah."},{"id":3343,"text":"I think he grew impatient."},{"id":3344,"text":"Anyway, he asked me if I didn't think it would be exciting to work in robotics."},{"id":3345,"text":"Naturally, I told him I could think of nothing duller."},{"id":3346,"text":"He was quite angry.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he never walked with you again after that.\"\r\n\r\nShe said, \"You know, I think that may have been it."},{"id":3347,"text":"I suppose his feelings were hurt."},{"id":3348,"text":"Really, though, what could I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was before that, though, that you told him about your quarrels with Dr."},{"id":3349,"text":"Delmarre.\"\r\n\r\nHer hands became fists and held so in a tight spasm."},{"id":3350,"text":"Her body\r\n\r\nheld stiffly to its position, head bent and a little to one side."},{"id":3351,"text":"Her voice was unnaturally high. \"What quarrels?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your quarrels with your husband."},{"id":3352,"text":"I understand you hated him.\" Her face was distorted and blotched as she glared at him. \"Who told you that?"},{"id":3353,"text":"Jothan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr."},{"id":3354,"text":"Leebig mentioned it."},{"id":3355,"text":"I think it's true.\"\r\n\r\nShe was shaken. \"You're still trying to prove I killed him."},{"id":3356,"text":"I keep thinking you're my friend and you're only-only a detective.\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her fists and Baley waited."},{"id":3357,"text":"He said, \"You know you can't touch me.\"\r\n\r\nHer hands dropped and she began crying without a sound."},{"id":3358,"text":"She turned her head away."},{"id":3359,"text":"Baley bent his own head and closed his eyes, shutting out the disturbing long shadows."},{"id":3360,"text":"He said, \"Dr."},{"id":3361,"text":"Delmarre was not a very affectionate man, was he?\"\r\n\r\nShe said in a strangled way, \"He was a very busy man.\"\r\n\r\nl3aley said, \"You are affectionate, on the other hand."},{"id":3362,"text":"You find a man interesting."},{"id":3363,"text":"Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I c-can't help it."},{"id":3364,"text":"I know it's disgusting, but I can't help it."},{"id":3365,"text":"It's even disgusting t-to talk about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did talk about it to Dr."},{"id":3366,"text":"Leebig, though?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had to do something and Jothan was handy and he didn't seem to mind and it made me feel better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was this the reason you quarreled with your husband?"},{"id":3367,"text":"Was it that he was cold and unaffectionate and you resented it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I hated him.\" She shrugged her shoulders helplessly. \"He was just a good Solarian and we weren't scheduled for ch-for ch--\" She broke down."},{"id":3368,"text":"Baley waited."},{"id":3369,"text":"His own stomach was cold and open air pressed down heavily upon him."},{"id":3370,"text":"When Gladia's sobs grew quieter, he asked, as gently as he could, \"Did you kill him, Gladia?\"\r\n\r\n\"N-no.\" Then, suddenly, as though all resistance had corroded within her: \"I haven't told you everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, please do so now.\" -\r\n\r\n\"We were quarreling that time, the time he died."},{"id":3371,"text":"The old quarrel."},{"id":3372,"text":"I screamed at him but he never shouted back."},{"id":3373,"text":"He hardly ever even\r\n\r\nsaid anything and that just made it worse."},{"id":3374,"text":"I was so angry, so angry."},{"id":3375,"text":"I don't remember after that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jehoshaphat!\" Baley swayed slightly and his eyes sought the\r\n\r\nneutral stone of the bench. \"What do you mean you don't remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean he was dead and I was screaming and the robots came--\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you kill him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember it, Elijah, and I would remember it if I did, wouldn't I?"},{"id":3376,"text":"Only I don't remember anything else, either, and I've been so frightened, so frightened."},{"id":3377,"text":"Help me, please, Elijah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, Gladia."},{"id":3378,"text":"I'll help you.\" Baley's reeling mind fastened on the murder weapon."},{"id":3379,"text":"What happened to it?"},{"id":3380,"text":"It must have been removed."},{"id":3381,"text":"If so, only the murderer could have done it."},{"id":3382,"text":"Since Gladia was found immediately after the murder on the scene, she could not have done it."},{"id":3383,"text":"The murderer would have to be someone else."},{"id":3384,"text":"No matter how it looked to everyone on Solaria, it had to be someone else."},{"id":3385,"text":"Baley thought sickly: I've got to get back to the house."},{"id":3386,"text":"He said, \"Gladia--\"\r\n\r\nSomehow he was staring at the sun."},{"id":3387,"text":"It was nearly at the

why."},{"id":3834,"text":"It had witnessed a murder which it had been powerless to stop.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you told me that that always brought about complete collapse; that that was a universal rule."},{"id":3835,"text":"Yet when Gruer was poisoned, the robot that had presented him with the poisoned drink was harmed only to the extent of a limp and a lisp."},{"id":3836,"text":"It had actually itself been the agent of what looked like murder at the moment, and not merely a witness, and yet it retained enough sanity to be questioned.\r\n\r\n\"This robot, the robot in the Delmarre

\"or if you had a dim notion of it, you despised yourself for your weakness, and hated Mrs."},{"id":3851,"text":"Delmarre for inspiring it."},{"id":3852,"text":"And yet you might have hated Delmarre, too, for having her."},{"id":3853,"text":"You did ask Mrs."},{"id":3854,"text":"Delmarre to be your assistant."},{"id":3855,"text":"You compromised with your libido that far."},{"id":3856,"text":"She refused and your hatred was the keener for that."},{"id":3857,"text":"By killing Dr."},{"id":3858,"text":"Delmarre in such a way as to throw suspicion on Mrs."},{"id":3859,"text":"Delmarre, you could be avenged on both at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who would believe that cheap, melodramatic filth?\" demanded Leebig in a hoarse whisper. \"Another Earthman, another animal, maybe."},{"id":3860,"text":"No Solarian.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't depend on that motive,\" said Baley. \"I think it was there, unconsciously, but you had a plainer motive, too."},{"id":3861,"text":"Dr."},{"id":3862,"text":"B.ikaine Delmarre was in the way of your plans, and had to be removed.\"\r\n\r\n'What plans?\" demanded Leebig.\r\n\r\n\"Your plans aiming at the conquest of the Galaxy, Dr."},{"id":3863,"text":"Leebig,\" said Baley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The earthman\" is mad,\" cried Leebig, turning to the others. \"Isn't that obvious?\"\r\n\r\nSome stared at Leebig wordlessly, some at Baley."},{"id":3864,"text":"Baley gave

so."},{"id":3872,"text":"Dr."},{"id":3873,"text":"Delmarre himself was planning a future in which ectogenesis would be possible and marriage unnecessary."},{"id":3874,"text":"But Dr."},{"id":3875,"text":"Delmarre was working with you; he would know, and guess, more about your work than anyone else."},{"id":3876,"text":"He would know if you were attempting dangerous experiments and he would try to stop you."},{"id":3877,"text":"He hinted about such matters to Agent Gruer, but gave no details, because he was not yet certain of the details."},{"id":3878,"text":"Obviously, you discovered his suspicions and killed him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mad!\" said Leebig again. \"I will have nothing more to do with this.\"\r\n\r\nBut Attlebish interrupted. \"Hear him out, Leebig!\"\r\n\r\nBaley bit his lip to keep from a premature display of satisfaction at the obvious lack of sympathy in the Security Head's voice."},{"id":3879,"text":"He said, \"In the same discussion with me in which you mentioned robots with detachable limbs, Dr."},{"id":3880,"text":"Leebig, you mentioned spaceships with built-in positronic brains."},{"id":3881,"text":"You were definitely talking too much then."},{"id":3882,"text":"Was it that you thought I was only an Earthman and incapable of understanding the implications of robotics?"},{"id":3883,"text":"Or was it that you had just been threatened

planet that was being bombarded."},{"id":3892,"text":"That would be difficult to manage."},{"id":3893,"text":"A robot could see that its own ship carried humans; it would know its own world held humans."},{"id":3894,"text":"It would assume that the same was true of enemy ships and worlds."},{"id":3895,"text":"It would take a real expert in robotics, such as you, Dr."},{"id":3896,"text":"Leebig, to handle them properly in that case, and there are very few suck experts.\r\n\r\n\"But a spaceship that was equipped with its own positronic brain would cheerfully attack any ship it was directed to attack, it seems to me."},{"id":3897,"text":"It would naturally assume all other ships were unmanned."},{"id":3898,"text":"A positronic-brained ship could easily be made incapable of receiving messages from enemy ships that might undeceive it."},{"id":3899,"text":"With its weapons and defenses under the immediate control of a positronic brain, it would be more maneuverable than any manned ship."},{"id":3900,"text":"With no room necessary for crewmen, for supplies, for water or air purifiers, it could carry more armor, more weapons and be more invulnerable

was no answer."},{"id":3907,"text":"No answer could have been heard."},{"id":3908,"text":"Something tore loose and the others were yelling madly."},{"id":3909,"text":"Klorissa had the face of a Fury

eyes."},{"id":3912,"text":"He tried for just a few moments to unknot his muscles, unfreeze his tendons."},{"id":3913,"text":"It had worked."},{"id":3914,"text":"He had pressed the right button at

relax."},{"id":3917,"text":"But what if some human threatened to teach the robots how to harm humans; to make them, in other words, capable of revolting?"},{"id":3918,"text":"Would that not be the ultimate crime?"},{"id":3919,"text":"On a world such as Solaria would not every last inhabitant turn fiercely against anyone even suspected of making a robot capable of harming a human; on Solana,

the master Olivaw.\"\r\n\r\nBaley took the message gravely, turned, and cried, \"One moment.\" His voice had an almost magical effect."},{"id":3923,"text":"All turned to look at him solemnly and in no face (outside Leebig's frozen glare) was there any sign of anything but the most painful attention to the Earthman."},{"id":3924,"text":"Baley said, \"It is foolish to expect
