sometimes.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley had."},{"id":80,"text":"He had heard many people moaning about the invention of the atomic pile."},{"id":81,"text":"He moaned about it himself when things went wrong, or when he got tired."},{"id":82,"text":"Moaning like that was a built-in facet of human nature."},{"id":83,"text":"Back in the Coal Century, people moaned about the invention of the steam engine."},{"id":84,"text":"In one of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, a character moaned about the invention of gunpowder."},{"id":85,"text":"A thousand years in the future, they\u2019d be moaning about the invention of the positronic brain."},{"id":86,"text":"The hell with it."},{"id":87,"text":"He said, grimly, \u201cLook, Julius.\u201d (It wasn\u2019t his habit to get friendly with the Commissioner

came in here for, and it\u2019s worrying me."},{"id":88,"text":"What is it?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner said, \u201cI\u2019ll get to it, Lije."},{"id":89,"text":"Let me do it my

in the sky once in a while."},{"id":94,"text":"I let in the City."},{"id":95,"text":"I look at it and I wonder what will become of it in another century.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley felt repelled by the other\u2019s sentimentality, but he found himself staring outward in fascination."},{"id":96,"text":"Even dimmed by the weather, the City was a tremendous thing to see."},{"id":97,"text":"The Police Department was in the upper levels of City Hall, and City Hall reached high."},{"id":98,"text":"From the Commissioner\u2019s window, the neighboring towers fell short and the tops were visible."},{"id":99,"text":"They were so many fingers, groping upward."},{"id":100,"text":"Their walls were blank, featureless."},{"id":101,"text":"They were the outer shells of human hives.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn a way,\u201d said the Commissioner, \u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s raining."},{"id":102,"text":"We can\u2019t see Spacetown.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley looked westward, but it was as the Commissioner said."},{"id":103,"text":"The horizon closed down."},{"id":104,"text":"New York\u2019s towers grew misty and came to an end against blank whiteness.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know what Spacetown is like,\u201d said Baley.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like the picture from here,\u201d said the Commissioner. \u201cIt can just be made out in the gap between the two Brunswick Sectors."},{"id":105,"text":"Low domes spread out."},{"id":106,"text":"It\u2019s the difference between us and the Spacers."},{"id":107,"text":"We reach high and crowd close."},{"id":108,"text":"With them, each family has a dome for

times."},{"id":112,"text":"About a month ago, I spoke to one right here on your intercom,\u201d Baley said, patiently.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I remember."},{"id":113,"text":"But then, I\u2019m just getting philosophical."},{"id":114,"text":"We and they."},{"id":115,"text":"Different ways of life.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley\u2019s stomach was beginning to constrict a little."},{"id":116,"text":"The more devious the Commissioner\u2019s approach, the deadlier he thought might be the conclusion."},{"id":117,"text":"He said, \u201cAll right."},{"id":118,"text":"But what\u2019s so surprising about it?"},{"id":119,"text":"You can\u2019t spread eight billion people over Earth in little domes."},{"id":120,"text":"They\u2019ve got space on their worlds, so let them live their way.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner walked to his chair and sat down."},{"id":121,"text":"His eyes looked unblinkingly at Baley, shrunken a bit by the concave lenses in his spectacles."},{"id":122,"text":"He said, \u201cNot everyone is that tolerant about differences in culture."},{"id":123,"text":"Either among us or among the Spacers.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right."},{"id":124,"text":"So what?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo three days ago, a Spacer died.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow it was coming."},{"id":125,"text":"The corners of Baley\u2019s thin lips raised a trifle, but the effect upon his long, sad face was unnoticeable."},{"id":126,"text":"He said, \u201cToo bad."},{"id":127,"text":"Something contagious, I hope."},{"id":128,"text":"A virus."},{"id":129,"text":"A cold, perhaps.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner looked startled, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Baley didn\u2019t care to explain."},{"id":130,"text":"The precision with which the Spacers had bred disease out of their societies was well known."},{"id":131,"text":"The care with which they avoided, as far as possible, contact with disease-riddled Earthmen was even better known."},{"id":132,"text":"But then, sarcasm was lost on the Commissioner."},{"id":133,"text":"Baley said, \u201cI\u2019m just talking."},{"id":134,"text":"What did he die of?\u201d He turned back to the window."},{"id":135,"text":"The Commissioner said, \u201cHe died of a missing chest."},{"id":136,"text":"Someone had used a blaster on him.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley\u2019s back grew rigid."},{"id":137,"text":"He said, without turning, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about murder,\u201d said the Commissioner, softly. \u201cYou\u2019re a plain-clothes man."},{"id":138,"text":"You know what murder is.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd now Baley turned. \u201cBut a Spacer!"},{"id":139,"text":"Three days ago?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut who did it?"},{"id":140,"text":"How?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Spacers say it was an Earthman.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?"},{"id":141,"text":"You don\u2019t like the

but--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was the fire at the Los Angeles factories."},{"id":145,"text":"There was the Berlin R-smashing."},{"id":146,"text":"There were the riots in Shanghai.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt all points to rising discontent."},{"id":147,"text":"Maybe to some sort of organization.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley said, \u201cCommissioner, I don\u2019t get this."},{"id":148,"text":"Are you testing me for some reason?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The Commissioner looked honestly bewildered."},{"id":149,"text":"Baley watched him. \u201cThree days ago a Spacer was murdered and the Spacers think the murderer is an Earthman."},{"id":150,"text":"Till now,\u201d his finger tapped the desk, \u201cnothing\u2019s come out."},{"id":151,"text":"Is that right?"},{"id":152,"text":"Commissioner, that\u2019s unbelievable."},{"id":153,"text":"Jehoshaphat, Commissioner, a thing like this would blow New York off the face of the planet if it really happened.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as that."},{"id":154,"text":"Look, Lije, I\u2019ve been out three days."},{"id":155,"text":"I\u2019ve been in conference with the Mayor."},{"id":156,"text":"I\u2019ve been out to Spacetown."},{"id":157,"text":"I\u2019ve been down in Washington, talking to the

inside city limits."},{"id":160,"text":"Spacetown is under New York jurisdiction.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut with extraterritorial rights.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know."},{"id":161,"text":"I\u2019m coming to that.\u201d The Commissioner\u2019s eyes fell away from Baley\u2019s flinty stare."},{"id":162,"text":"He seemed to regard himself as having been suddenly demoted to the position of Baley\u2019s underling, and Baley behaved as though he accepted the fact.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Spacers can run the show,\u201d said Baley.\r\n\r\n\u201cWait a minute, Lije,\u201d pleaded the Commissioner. \u201cDon\u2019t rush me."},{"id":163,"text":"I\u2019m trying to talk this over, friend to friend."},{"id":164,"text":"I want you to know my position."},{"id":165,"text":"I was there when the news

days."},{"id":172,"text":"That won\u2019t happen again, at least."},{"id":173,"text":"I\u2019ve ordered three pairs.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley considered the picture he conjured up of the event."},{"id":174,"text":"He could see the tall, fair figures of the Spacers approaching the Commissioner with the news and breaking it to him in their unvarnished emotionless way."},{"id":175,"text":"Julius would remove his glasses and polish them."},{"id":176,"text":"Inevitably, under the impact of the event, he would drop them, then look down at the broken remnants with a quiver of his soft, full lips."},{"id":177,"text":"Baley was quite certain that, for five minutes anyway, the Commissioner was much more disturbed over his glasses than over the murder."},{"id":178,"text":"The Commissioner was saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a devil of a position."},{"id":179,"text":"As you say, the Spacers have extraterritorial rights."},{"id":180,"text":"They can

of suicide not to pay.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to draw me a picture,\u201d said Baley."},{"id":183,"text":"He had been a small boy when the gleaming cruisers from outer space last sent

was removed and the City Police entrusted with the protection of Spacetown\u2019s isolation."},{"id":312,"text":"Most important of all, the medical examination was more unobtrusive."},{"id":313,"text":"Now, thought Baley, things might take a reverse trend."},{"id":314,"text":"If the Spacers seriously thought that an Earthman had entered Spacetown and committed murder, the barrier might go up again."},{"id":315,"text":"It would be bad."},{"id":316,"text":"He lifted himself onto the expressway platform, made his way through the standees to the tight spiral

it."},{"id":321,"text":"Most Earthmen were Medievalists in one way or another."},{"id":322,"text":"It was an easy thing to be when it meant looking back to a time when Earth was the world and not just one of fifty."},{"id":323,"text":"The misfit one of fifty at that."},{"id":324,"text":"Baley\u2019s head snapped to the right at the sound of a female shriek."},{"id":325,"text":"A woman had dropped her handbag; he saw it for an instant, a pastel pink blob against the dull gray of the strips."},{"id":326,"text":"A passenger hurrying from the expressway must inadvertently have kicked it in the direction of deceleration and now the owner was whirling away from her property."},{"id":327,"text":"A corner of Baley\u2019s mouth quirked."},{"id":328,"text":"She might catch up with it, if she were

scene was half a mile to the rear, already."},{"id":331,"text":"Chances were she wouldn\u2019t."},{"id":332,"text":"It had been calculated that, on the average, something was dropped on the strips every three minutes somewhere in the City and not recovered."},{"id":333,"text":"The Lost and Found Department was a huge proposition."},{"id":334,"text":"It was just one more complication of modern

being."},{"id":346,"text":"Larger than any City but Los Angeles."},{"id":347,"text":"More populous than any but Shanghai."},{"id":348,"text":"It was only three centuries old."},{"id":349,"text":"To be sure, something had existed in the same geographic area before then that had been called New York City."},{"id":350,"text":"That primitive gathering of population had existed for three thousand years, not three hundred, but it hadn\u2019t been a City."},{"id":351,"text":"There were no Cities then."},{"id":352,"text":"There were just huddles of dwelling places large and small, open to the air."},{"id":353,"text":"They were something like the Spacer\u2019s Domes, only much different, of course."},{"id":354,"text":"These huddles (the largest barely reached ten million in population and

thing."},{"id":359,"text":"A radical change had to take place in man\u2019s culture, particularly when it turned out that the Outer Worlds (which had merely been Earth\u2019s colonies a thousand years before) were tremendously serious in their immigration restrictions."},{"id":360,"text":"The radical change had been the gradual formation of the Cities over a thousand years of Earth\u2019s history."},{"id":361,"text":"Efficiency implied bigness."},{"id":362,"text":"Even in Medieval times that had been realized, perhaps unconsciously."},{"id":363,"text":"Home industry gave way to factories and factories to continental industries."},{"id":364,"text":"Think of the inefficiency of a hundred thousand houses for a hundred thousand families as compared with a hundred-thousand-unit Section; a book-film collection in each house as compared with a Section film concentrate; independent video for each family as compared with video-piping systems."},{"id":365,"text":"For that matter, take the simple folly of endless duplication of kitchens and bathrooms as compared with the thoroughly efficient diners and shower rooms made possible by City culture."},{"id":366,"text":"More and more the villages, towns, and \u201ccities\u201d of Earth died and were swallowed by the Cities."},{"id":367,"text":"Even the early prospects of atomic war only slowed the trend."},{"id":368,"text":"With the invention of the force shield, the trend became a headlong race."},{"id":369,"text":"City culture meant optimum distribution of food, increasing utilization of yeasts and hydroponics."},{"id":370,"text":"New York City spread over two thousand square miles and at the last census its population was well over twenty million."},{"id":371,"text":"There were some eight hundred Cities on Earth, average population, ten million."},{"id":372,"text":"Each City became a semiautonomous unit, economically all but self-sufficient."},{"id":373,"text":"It could roof itself in, gird itself about, burrow itself under."},{"id":374,"text":"It became a steel cave, a tremendous, self-contained cave of steel and concrete."},{"id":375,"text":"It could lay itself out scientifically."},{"id":376,"text":"At the center was the enormous complex of administrative offices."},{"id":377,"text":"In careful orientation to one another and to the whole were the large residential Sections connected and interlaced by the expressway and the localways."},{"id":378,"text":"Toward the outskirts were the factories, the hydroponic plants, the yeast-culture vats, the power plants."},{"id":379,"text":"Through all the melee were the water pipes and sewage ducts, schools, prisons and shops, power lines and communication beams."},{"id":380,"text":"There was no doubt about it: the City was the culmination of man\u2019s mastery over the environment."},{"id":381,"text":"Not space travel, not the fifty colonized worlds that were now so haughtily independent, but the City."},{"id":382,"text":"Practically none of Earth\u2019s population lived outside the Cities."},{"id":383,"text":"Outside was the wilderness, the open sky that few men could face with anything like equanimity."},{"id":384,"text":"To be sure, the open space was necessary."},{"id":385,"text":"It held the water that men must have, the coal and the wood that were the ultimate raw materials for plastics and for the eternally growing yeast.

The land between the Cities still held the mines, and was still used to a larger extent than most men realized for growing food and grazing stock."},{"id":386,"text":"It was inefficient, but beef, pork, and grain always found a luxury market and could be used for export purposes."},{"id":387,"text":"But few humans were required to run the mines and ranches, to exploit the farms and pipe the water, and these supervised at long distance."},{"id":388,"text":"Robots did the work better and required less."},{"id":389,"text":"Robots!"},{"id":390,"text":"That was the one huge irony."},{"id":391,"text":"It was on Earth that the positronic brain was invented and on Earth that robots had first been put to productive use."},{"id":392,"text":"Not on the Outer Worlds."},{"id":393,"text":"Of course, the Outer Worlds always acted as though robots had been born of their culture."},{"id":394,"text":"In a way, of course, the culmination of robot economy had taken place on the Outer Worlds."},{"id":395,"text":"Here on Earth, robots had always been restricted to the mines and farmlands."},{"id":396,"text":"Only in the last quarter century, under the urgings of the Spacers, had robots filtered their slow way into the Cities."},{"id":397,"text":"The Cities were good."},{"id":398,"text":"Everyone but the Medievalists knew that there was no substitute, no reasonable substitute."},{"id":399,"text":"The only trouble was that they wouldn\u2019t stay good."},{"id":400,"text":"Earth\u2019s population was still rising."},{"id":401,"text":"Some day, with all that the Cities could do, the available calories per person would simply fall below basic subsistence level."},{"id":402,"text":"It was all the worse because of the existence of the Spacers, the descendants of the early emigrants from Earth, living in luxury on their under-populated robot-ridden worlds out in space."},{"id":403,"text":"They were coolly determined to keep the comfort that grew out of the emptiness of their worlds and for that purpose they kept their birth rate down and immigrants from teeming Earth out."},{"id":404,"text":"And this--\r\n\r\nSpacetown

himself speeding southwestward to the Trenton Section turning of the way, through the heart of the warm and musty-odored yeast country."},{"id":407,"text":"It was a matter of timing."},{"id":408,"text":"It took so long to shinny down the ramp, so long to squirm through the grunting standees, so long to slip along the railing and out an opening, so long to hop across the decelerating strips."},{"id":409,"text":"When he was done, he was precisely at the off-shooting of the proper stationary."},{"id":410,"text":"At no time did he time his steps consciously."},{"id":411,"text":"If he had, he would probably have missed."},{"id":412,"text":"Baley found himself in unusual semi-isolation."},{"id":413,"text":"Only a policeman was with him inside

impatiently."},{"id":415,"text":"The policeman lifted his hand in permission to pass on."},{"id":416,"text":"The passage narrowed and curved sharply three or four times."},{"id":417,"text":"That was obviously purposeful."},{"id":418,"text":"Mobs of Earthmen couldn\u2019t gather in it with any degree of comfort and direct charges were impossible."},{"id":419,"text":"Baley was thankful that the arrangements were for him to meet his partner this side of Spacetown."},{"id":420,"text":"He didn\u2019t like the thought of a medical examination any better for its reputed politeness."},{"id":421,"text":"A Spacer was standing at the point where a series of doors marked the openings to the open air and the domes of Spacetown."},{"id":422,"text":"He was dressed in the Earth fashion, trousers tight at the waist, loose at the ankle, and color-striped down the seam of each leg."},{"id":423,"text":"He wore an ordinary Textron shirt, open collar, seam-zipped, and ruffled at the wrist, but he was a Spacer."},{"id":424,"text":"There was something about the way he stood, the way he held his head, the calm and unemotional lines of his broad, high-cheekboned face, the careful set of his short, bronze hair lying flatly backward and without a part, that marked him off from the native Earthman."},{"id":425,"text":"Baley approached woodenly and said in a monotone, \u201cI am Plain-clothes Man Elijah Baley, Police Department, City of New York, Rating C-5.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe showed his credentials and went on, \u201cI have been instructed to meet R."},{"id":426,"text":"Daneel Olivaw at Spacetown Approachway.\u201d He looked at his watch. \u201cI am a little early."},{"id":427,"text":"May I request the announcement of my presence?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe felt more than a little cold inside."},{"id":428,"text":"He was used, after a fashion, to the Earth-model robots."},{"id":429,"text":"The Spacer models would be different."},{"id":430,"text":"He had never met one, but there was nothing more common on Earth than the horrid whispered stories about the tremendous and formidable robots that worked in superhuman fashion on the far-off, glittering Outer Worlds."},{"id":431,"text":"He found himself gritting his teeth."},{"id":432,"text":"The Spacer, who had listened politely, said, \u201cIt will not be necessary."},{"id":433,"text":"I have been waiting for you.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley\u2019s hand went up automatically, then dropped."},{"id":434,"text":"So did his long chin, looking longer in the process."},{"id":435,"text":"He didn\u2019t quite manage to say anything."},{"id":436,"text":"The words froze."},{"id":437,"text":"The Spacer said, \u201cI shall introduce myself."},{"id":438,"text":"I am R."},{"id":439,"text":"Daneel Olivaw.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?"},{"id":440,"text":"Am I making a mistake?"},{"id":441,"text":"I thought the first initial--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so."},{"id":442,"text":"I am a robot."},{"id":443,"text":"Were you not told?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was told.\u201d Baley put a damp hand to his hair and smoothed it back unnecessarily."},{"id":444,"text":"Then he held it out. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr."},{"id":445,"text":"Olivaw."},{"id":446,"text":"I don\u2019t know what I was thinking of."},{"id":447,"text":"Good day."},{"id":448,"text":"I am Elijah Baley, your partner.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d The robot\u2019s hand closed on his with a smoothly increasing pressure that reached a comfortably friendly peak, then declined. \u201cYet I seem to detect disturbance."},{"id":449,"text":"May I ask that you be frank with me?"},{"id":450,"text":"It is best to have as many relevant facts as possible in a relationship such as ours."},{"id":451,"text":"And it is customary on my world for partners to call one another by the familiar name."},{"id":452,"text":"I trust that that is not counter to your own customs.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, you see, that you don\u2019t look like a robot,\u201d said Baley, desperately.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd that disturbs you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t, I suppose, Da--Daneel."},{"id":453,"text":"Are they all like you on your world?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are individual differences, Elijah, as with

see."},{"id":456,"text":"You expected a rather crude model and were surprised."},{"id":457,"text":"Yet it is only logical that our people use a robot of pronounced humanoid characteristics in this case if we expected to avoid unpleasantness."},{"id":458,"text":"Is that not so?\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was certainly so."},{"id":459,"text":"An obvious robot roaming the City would be in quick trouble."},{"id":460,"text":"Baley said, \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen let us leave now, Elijah.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey made their way back to the expressway."},{"id":461,"text":"R."},{"id":462,"text":"Daneel caught the purpose of the accelerating strips and maneuvered along them with a quick proficiency."},{"id":463,"text":"Baley, who had begun by moderating his speed, ended by hastening it in annoyance."},{"id":464,"text":"The robot kept pace."},{"id":465,"text":"He showed no awareness of any difficulty."},{"id":466,"text":"Baley wondered if R."},{"id":467,"text":"Daneel were not deliberately moving slower than he might."},{"id":468,"text":"He reached the endless cars of expressway and scrambled aboard with what amounted to outright recklessness."},{"id":469,"text":"The robot followed easily."},{"id":470,"text":"Baley was red."},{"id":471,"text":"He swallowed twice and said, \u201cI\u2019ll stay down here with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDown here?\u201d The robot, apparently oblivious to both the noise and the rhythmic swaying of the platform said, \u201cIs my information wrong?"},{"id":472,"text":"I was told that a rating of C-5 entitled one to a seat on the upper level under certain conditions.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right."},{"id":473,"text":"I can go up there, but you can\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy can I not go up with you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt takes a C-5, Daneel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am aware of that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a C-5.\u201d Talking was difficult."},{"id":474,"text":"The hiss of frictioning air was louder on the less shielded lower level and Baley was understandably anxious to keep his voice low."},{"id":475,"text":"R."},{"id":476,"text":"Daneel said, \u201cWhy should I not be a C-5?"},{"id":477,"text":"I am your partner and, consequently, of equal rank."},{"id":478,"text":"I was given this.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrom an inner shirt pocket he produced a rectangular credential card, quite genuine."},{"id":479,"text":"The name given was Daneel Olivaw, without the all-important initial."},{"id":480,"text":"The rating was [C-5].\r\n\r\n\u201cCome on up,\u201d said Baley, woodenly."},{"id":481,"text":"Baley looked straight ahead, once seated, angry with himself, very conscious of the robot sitting next to him."},{"id":482,"text":"He had been caught twice."},{"id":483,"text":"First he had not recognized R."},{"id":484,"text":"Daneel as a robot; secondly, he had not guessed the logic that demanded R."},{"id":485,"text":"Daneel be given C-5 rating."},{"id":486,"text":"The trouble was, of course, that he was not the plain-clothes man of popular myth."},{"id":487,"text":"He was not incapable of surprise, imperturbable of appearance, infinite of adaptability, and lightning of mental grasp."},{"id":488,"text":"He had never supposed he was, but he had never regretted the lack before."},{"id":489,"text":"What made him regret it was that, to all appearances, R."},{"id":490,"text":"Daneel Olivaw was that very myth, embodied."},{"id":491,"text":"He had to be."},{"id":492,"text":"He was a robot."},{"id":493,"text":"Baley began to find excuses for himself."},{"id":494,"text":"He was accustomed to the robots like R."},{"id":495,"text":"Sammy at the office."},{"id":496,"text":"He had expected a creature with a skin of a hard and glossy plastic, nearly dead white in color."},{"id":497,"text":"He had expected an expression fixed at an unreal level of inane good humor."},{"id":498,"text":"He had expected jerky, faintly uncertain motions."},{"id":499,"text":"R."},{"id":500,"text":"Daneel was none of it."},{"id":501,"text":"Baley risked a quick side glance at the robot."},{"id":502,"text":"R."},{"id":503,"text":"Daneel turned simultaneously to meet his eye and nod gravely."},{"id":504,"text":"His lips had moved naturally when he had spoken and did not simply remain parted as those of Earth robots did."},{"id":505,"text":"There had been glimpses of an articulating tongue."},{"id":506,"text":"Baley thought: Why does he have to sit there so calmly?"},{"id":507,"text":"This must be something completely new to him."},{"id":508,"text":"Noise, lights, crowds!"},{"id":509,"text":"Baley got up, brushed past R."},{"id":510,"text":"Daneel, and said, \u201cFollow me!\u201d\r\n\r\nOff the expressway, down the decelerating strips."},{"id":511,"text":"Baley thought: Good Lord, what do I tell Jessie, anyway?"},{"id":512,"text":"The coming of the robot had rattled that thought out of his head, but it was coming back with sickening urgency now that they were heading down the localway that led into the very jaws of the Lower Bronx Section."},{"id":513,"text":"He said, \u201cThis is all one building, you know, Daneel; everything you see, the whole City."},{"id":514,"text":"Twenty million people live in it."},{"id":515,"text":"The expressways go continuously, night and day, at sixty miles an hour."},{"id":516,"text":"There are two hundred and fifty miles of it altogether and hundreds of miles of localways.\u201d\r\n\r\nAny minute now, Baley thought, I\u2019ll be figuring out how many tons of yeast product New York eats per day and how many cubic feet of water we drink and how many megawatts of power the atomic piles deliver per hour."},{"id":517,"text":"Daneel said, \u201cI was informed of this and other similar data in my briefing.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley thought: Well, that covers the food, drink, and power situation, too, I suppose."},{"id":518,"text":"Why try to impress a robot?"},{"id":519,"text":"They were at East 182nd Street and in not more than two hundred yards they would be at the elevator banks that fed those steel and concrete layers of apartments that included his own."},{"id":520,"text":"He was on the point of saying, \u201cThis way,\u201d when he was stopped by a knot of people gathering outside the brilliantly lighted force door of one of the many retail departments that lined the ground levels solidly in this Section."},{"id":521,"text":"He asked of the nearest person in an automatic tone of authority, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man he addressed, who was standing on tiptoe, said, \u201cDamned if I know."},{"id":522,"text":"I just got here.\u201d\r\n\r\nSomeone else said, excitedly, \u201cThey got those lousy R\u2019s in there."},{"id":523,"text":"I think maybe they\u2019ll throw them out here."},{"id":524,"text":"Boy, I\u2019d like to take them apart.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley looked nervously at Daneel, but, if the latter caught the significance of the words or even heard them, he did not show it by any outward sign."},{"id":525,"text":"Baley plunged into the crowd. \u201cLet me through."},{"id":526,"text":"Let me through."},{"id":527,"text":"Police!\u201d\r\n\r\nThey made way."},{"id":528,"text":"Baley

laughed."},{"id":532,"text":"Baley turned a little cold."},{"id":533,"text":"The City was the acme of efficiency, but it made demands of its inhabitants."},{"id":534,"text":"It asked them to live in a tight routine and order their lives under a strict and scientific control."},{"id":535,"text":"Occasionally, built-up inhibitions exploded."},{"id":536,"text":"He remembered the Barrier Riots."},{"id":537,"text":"Reasons for anti-robot rioting certainly existed."},{"id":538,"text":"Men who found themselves faced with the prospect of the desperate minimum involved in declassification, after half a lifetime of effort, could not decide cold-bloodedly that individual robots were not to blame."},{"id":539,"text":"Individual robots could at least be struck at."},{"id":540,"text":"One could not strike at something called \u201cgovernmental policy\u201d or at a slogan like \u201cHigher production with robot labor.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe government called it growing pains."},{"id":541,"text":"It shook its collective head sorrowfully and assured everyone that after a necessary period of adjustment, a new and better life would exist for all."},{"id":542,"text":"But the Medievalist movement expanded along with the declassification process."},{"id":543,"text":"Men grew desperate and the border between bitter frustration and wild destruction is sometimes easily crossed."},{"id":544,"text":"At this moment, minutes could be separating the pent-up hostility of the crowd from a flashing orgy of blood and smash."},{"id":545,"text":"Baley writhed his way desperately to the force door."},{"id":546,"text":"Chapter 3\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENT AT A SHOE COUNTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interior of the store was emptier than the street outside."},{"id":547,"text":"The manager, with commendable foresight, had thrown the force door early in the game, preventing potential troublemakers from entering."},{"id":548,"text":"It also kept the principles in the argument from leaving, but that was minor."},{"id":549,"text":"Baley got through the force door by using his officer\u2019s neutralizer."},{"id":550,"text":"Unexpectedly, he found R."},{"id":551,"text":"Daneel still behind him."},{"id":552,"text":"The robot was pocketing a neutralizer of his own, a slim one, smaller and neater than the standard police model."},{"id":553,"text":"The manager ran to them instantly, talking loudly. \u201cOfficers, my clerks have been assigned me by the City."},{"id":554,"text":"I am perfectly within my rights.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere were three robots standing rodlike at the rear of the department."},{"id":555,"text":"Six humans were standing near the force door."},{"id":556,"text":"They were all women.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right, now,\u201d said Baley, crisply. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?"},{"id":557,"text":"What\u2019s all the fuss about?\u201d\r\n\r\nOne of the women said, shrilly, \u201cI came in for shoes."},{"id":558,"text":"Why can\u2019t I have a decent clerk?"},{"id":559,"text":"Ain\u2019t I respectable?\u201d Her clothing, especially her hat, were just sufficiently extreme to make it more than a rhetorical question."},{"id":560,"text":"The angry flush that covered her face masked imperfectly her overdone makeup."},{"id":561,"text":"The manager said, \u201cI\u2019ll wait on her myself if I have to, but I can\u2019t wait on all of them, Officer."},{"id":562,"text":"There\u2019s nothing wrong with my men."},{"id":563,"text":"They\u2019re registered clerks."},{"id":564,"text":"I have their spec charts and guarantee

all the ro-bots, if I was boss."},{"id":575,"text":"I tell you that!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe others talked confusedly and there was always the growing rumble from the crowd just beyond the force

were Earthmade, and even on that scale, relatively inexpensive models."},{"id":580,"text":"They were just robots made to know a few simple things."},{"id":581,"text":"They would know all the style numbers, their prices, the sizes available in each."},{"id":582,"text":"They could keep track of stock fluctuations, probably better than humans could, since they would have no outside interests."},{"id":583,"text":"They could compute the proper orders for the next week."},{"id":584,"text":"They could measure the customer\u2019s foot."},{"id":585,"text":"In themselves,

long."},{"id":601,"text":"His father he recalled well, a sodden man, morose and lost, speaking sometimes of the past in hoarse, broken sentences."},{"id":602,"text":"His father died, still

right?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are quite right, Elijah.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey tie it up with recent attempts to sabotage the Spacer-sponsored project of converting us to an integrated human\/robot

unsatisfactory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTough,\u201d muttered Baley.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have been told that when Spacetown was first established, it was taken for granted by most of our people that Earth would be willing to adopt the integrated society that has worked so well on the Outer Worlds."},{"id":1084,"text":"Even after the first riots, we thought that it was only a matter of your people getting over the first shock of novelty.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat has not proven to be the case."},{"id":1085,"text":"Even with the co-operation of the Terrestrial government and of most of the various City

it."},{"id":1506,"text":"He inverted the pipe itself over the desk\u2019s small ash vacuum and let the powdery white tobacco ash vanish."},{"id":1507,"text":"He looked regretfully at the empty pipe,

shoulders and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways, Lije."},{"id":1531,"text":"The public insists that City robots be built with a strong friendship circuit."},{"id":1532,"text":"All right,

no need for specialized friendship circuits."},{"id":1538,"text":"Yet the Commissioner was right."},{"id":1539,"text":"The Earthman\u2019s distrust for robots was something quite irrational and

smiled."},{"id":1543,"text":"Sighing, Baley rose to his feet."},{"id":1544,"text":"He thought: Spacetown, next stop-- or, maybe, last stop!"},{"id":1545,"text":"The police forces of the City, as well

knew without looking, another blind and hollow worm continually contracted and closed."},{"id":1555,"text":"The motorway was well lit, but lighting was meaningless in the silence and emptiness."},{"id":1556,"text":"R."},{"id":1557,"text":"Daneel did nothing to break that silence or fill that emptiness."},{"id":1558,"text":"He looked straight ahead, as unimpressed by the empty motorway as by the bulging expressway."},{"id":1559,"text":"In one sounding moment, to the tune of a wild whine of the squad car\u2019s siren, they popped out of the motorway and curved gradually into the vehicular lane of a City corridor."},{"id":1560,"text":"The vehicular lanes were still conscientiously marked down each major corridor in reverence for one vestigial portion of the past."},{"id":1561,"text":"There were no vehicles any longer, except for squad cars, fire engines, and maintenance trucks, and pedestrians used the lanes in complete self-assurance."},{"id":1562,"text":"They scattered in indignant hurry before the advance of Baley\u2019s squealing car."},{"id":1563,"text":"Baley, himself, drew a freer breath as noise surged in about him, but it was an interval only."},{"id":1564,"text":"In less than two hundred yards they turned into the subdued corridors that led to Spacetown Entrance."},{"id":1565,"text":"They were expected."},{"id":1566,"text":"The guards obviously knew R."},{"id":1567,"text":"Daneel by sight and, although themselves human, nodded to him without the least self-consciousness."},{"id":1568,"text":"One approached Baley and saluted with perfect, if frigid, military courtesy."},{"id":1569,"text":"He was tall and grave, though not the perfect specimen of Spacer physique that R."},{"id":1570,"text":"Daneel was."},{"id":1571,"text":"He said, \u201cYour identification card, if you please, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was inspected quickly but thoroughly."},{"id":1572,"text":"Baley noticed that the guard wore flesh-colored gloves and had an all but unnoticeable filter in each nostril."},{"id":1573,"text":"The guard saluted again and returned the card."},{"id":1574,"text":"He said, \u201cThere is a small Men\u2019s Personal here which we would be pleased to have you use if you wish to shower.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was in Baley\u2019s mind to deny the necessity, but R."},{"id":1575,"text":"Daneel plucked gently at his sleeve, as the guard stepped back to his place."},{"id":1576,"text":"R."},{"id":1577,"text":"Daneel said, \u201cIt is customary, partner Elijah, for City dwellers to shower before entering Spacetown."},{"id":1578,"text":"I tell you this since I know you have no desire, through lack of information on this matter, to render yourself or ourselves uncomfortable."},{"id":1579,"text":"It is also advisable for you to attend to any matters of personal hygiene you may think advisable."},{"id":1580,"text":"There will be no facilities within Spacetown for that purpose.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo facilities!\u201d said Baley, strenuously. \u201cBut that\u2019s impossible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI mean, of course,\u201d said R."},{"id":1581,"text":"Daneel, \u201cnone for use by City dwellers.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley\u2019s face filled with a clearly hostile astonishment."},{"id":1582,"text":"R."},{"id":1583,"text":"Daneel said, \u201cI regret the situation, but it is a matter of custom.\u201d\r\n\r\nWordlessly, Baley entered the Personal."},{"id":1584,"text":"He felt, rather than saw, R."},{"id":1585,"text":"Daneel entering behind him."},{"id":1586,"text":"He thought: Checking on me?"},{"id":1587,"text":"Making sure I wash the City dust off myself?"},{"id":1588,"text":"For a furious moment, he reveled in the thought of the shock he was preparing for Spacetown."},{"id":1589,"text":"It seemed to him suddenly minor that he might, in effect, be pointing a blaster at his own chest."},{"id":1590,"text":"The Personal was small, but it was well appointed and antiseptic in its cleanliness."},{"id":1591,"text":"There was a trace of sharpness in the air."},{"id":1592,"text":"Baley sniffed at it, momentarily puzzled."},{"id":1593,"text":"Then he thought: Ozone!"},{"id":1594,"text":"They\u2019ve got ultraviolet radiation flooding the place."},{"id":1595,"text":"A little sign blinked on and off several times, then remained steadily lit."},{"id":1596,"text":"It said, \u201cVisitor will please remove all clothing, including shoes, and place it in the receptacle below.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley acquiesced."},{"id":1597,"text":"He unhitched his blaster and blaster strap and recircled it about his naked waist."},{"id":1598,"text":"It felt heavy and uncomfortable."},{"id":1599,"text":"The receptacle closed and his clothing was gone."},{"id":1600,"text":"The lighted sign blanked out."},{"id":1601,"text":"A new sign flashed ahead."},{"id":1602,"text":"It said: \u201cVisitor will please tend to personal needs, then make use of the shower indicated by arrow.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley felt like a machine tool being shaped by long-distance force edges on an assembly line."},{"id":1603,"text":"His first act upon entering the small shower cubicle was to draw up the moisture-proof flap on his blaster holster and clip it down firmly all about."},{"id":1604,"text":"He knew by long-standing test that he could still draw and use it in less than five seconds."},{"id":1605,"text":"There was no knob or hook on which to hang his blaster."},{"id":1606,"text":"There was not even a visible shower head."},{"id":1607,"text":"He placed it in a corner away from the cubicle\u2019s entrance door."},{"id":1608,"text":"Another sign flashed: \u201cVisitor will please hold arms directly out from his body and stand in the central circle with feet in the indicated positions.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he placed his feet in the small depressions allowed for them, the sign blanked out."},{"id":1609,"text":"As it did so, a stinging, foaming spray hit him from ceiling, floor, and four walls."},{"id":1610,"text":"He felt the water welling up even beneath the soles of his feet."},{"id":1611,"text":"For a full minute it lasted, his skin reddening under the combined force of the heat and pressure and his lungs gasping for air in the warm dampness."},{"id":1612,"text":"There followed another minute of cool, low-pressure spray, and then finally a minute of warm air that left him dry and refreshed."},{"id":1613,"text":"He picked up his blaster and blaster strap and found that they, too, were dry and warm."},{"id":1614,"text":"He strapped them on and stepped out of the cubicle in time to see R."},{"id":1615,"text":"Daneel emerge from a neighboring shower."},{"id":1616,"text":"Of course!"},{"id":1617,"text":"R."},{"id":1618,"text":"Daneel was not a City dweller, but he had accumulated City dust."},{"id":1619,"text":"Quite automatically, Baley looked away."},{"id":1620,"text":"Then, with the thought that, after all, R."},{"id":1621,"text":"Daneel\u2019s customs were not City customs, he forced his unwilling eyes back for one moment."},{"id":1622,"text":"His lips quirked in a tiny smile."},{"id":1623,"text":"R."},{"id":1624,"text":"Daneel\u2019s resemblance to humanity was not restricted to his face and hands but had been carried out with painstaking accuracy over the entire body."},{"id":1625,"text":"Baley stepped forward in the direction he had been traveling continuously since entering the Personal."},{"id":1626,"text":"He found his clothes waiting for him, neatly folded."},{"id":1627,"text":"They had a warm, clean odor to them."},{"id":1628,"text":"A sign said, \u201cVisitor will please resume his clothing and place his hand in the indicated depression.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley did so."},{"id":1629,"text":"He felt a definite tingling in the ball of his middle finger as he laid it down upon the clean, milky surface."},{"id":1630,"text":"He lifted his hand hastily and found a little drop of blood oozing out."},{"id":1631,"text":"As he watched, it stopped flowing."},{"id":1632,"text":"He shook it off and pinched the finger."},{"id":1633,"text":"No more blood was flowing even then."},{"id":1634,"text":"Obviously, they were analyzing his blood."},{"id":1635,"text":"He felt a definite pang of anxiety."},{"id":1636,"text":"His own yearly routine examination by Department doctors, he felt sure, was not carried on with the thoroughness or, perhaps, with the knowledge of these cold robot-makers from outer space."},{"id":1637,"text":"He was not sure he wanted too probing an inquiry into the state of his health."},{"id":1638,"text":"The time of waiting seemed long to Baley, but when the light flashed again, it said simply, \u201cVisitor will proceed.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley drew a long breath of relief."},{"id":1639,"text":"He walked onward and stepped through an archway."},{"id":1640,"text":"Two metal rods closed in before him and, written in luminous air, were the words: \u201cVisitor is warned to proceed no further.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the devil--\u201d called out Baley, forgetting in his anger the fact that he was still in the Personal."},{"id":1641,"text":"R."},{"id":1642,"text":"Daneel\u2019s voice was in his ear. \u201cThe sniffers have detected a power source, I imagine."},{"id":1643,"text":"Are you carrying your blaster, Elijah?\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley whirled, his face a deep crimson."},{"id":1644,"text":"He tried twice, then managed to croak out, \u201cA police officer has his blaster on him or in easy reach at all times, on duty and off.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was the first time he had spoken in a Personal, proper, since he was ten years old."},{"id":1645,"text":"That had been in his uncle Boris\u2019s presence and had merely been an automatic complaint when he stubbed his toe."},{"id":1646,"text":"Uncle Boris had beaten him well when he reached home and had lectured him strongly on the necessities of public decency."},{"id":1647,"text":"R."},{"id":1648,"text":"Daneel said, \u201cNo visitor may be armed."},{"id":1649,"text":"It is our custom, Elijah."},{"id":1650,"text":"Even your Commissioner leaves his blaster behind on all visits.\u201d\r\n\r\nUnder almost any other circumstances, Baley would have turned on his heel and walked away, away from Spacetown and away from that robot."},{"id":1651,"text":"Now, however, he was almost mad with desire to go through with his exact plan and have his revenge to the brim in that way."},{"id":1652,"text":"This, he thought, was the unobtrusive medical examination that had replaced the more detailed one of the early days."},{"id":1653,"text":"He could well understand, he could understand to overflowing, the indignation and anger that had led to the Barrier Riots of his youth."},{"id":1654,"text":"In black anger, Baley unhitched his blaster belt."},{"id":1655,"text":"R."},{"id":1656,"text":"Daneel took it from him and placed it within a recess in the wall."},{"id":1657,"text":"A thin metal plate slithered across it.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you will put your thumb in the depression,\u201d said R."},{"id":1658,"text":"Daneel, \u201conly your thumb will open it later on.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley felt undressed, far more so, in fact, than he had felt in the shower."},{"id":1659,"text":"He stepped across the point at which the rods had lately barred him, and, finally, out of the Personal."},{"id":1660,"text":"He was back in a corridor again, but there was an element of strangeness about it."},{"id":1661,"text":"Up ahead, the light had an unfamiliar quality to it."},{"id":1662,"text":"He felt a whiff of air against his face and, automatically, he thought a squad car had passed."},{"id":1663,"text":"R."},{"id":1664,"text":"Daneel must have read his uneasiness in his face."},{"id":1665,"text":"He said, \u201cYou are essentially in open air now, Elijah."},{"id":1666,"text":"It is unconditioned.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley felt faintly sick."},{"id":1667,"text":"How could the Spacers be so rigidly careful of a human body, merely because it came from the City, and then breathe the dirty air of the open fields?"},{"id":1668,"text":"He tightened his nostrils, as though by pulling them together he could the more effectively screen the ingoing air."},{"id":1669,"text":"R."},{"id":1670,"text":"Daneel said, \u201cI believe you will find that open air is not deleterious to human health.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Baley, faintly."},{"id":1671,"text":"The air currents hit annoyingly against his face."},{"id":1672,"text":"They were gentle enough, but they were erratic."},{"id":1673,"text":"That bothered him."},{"id":1674,"text":"Worse came."},{"id":1675,"text":"The corridor opened into blueness and as they approached its end, strong white light washed down."},{"id":1676,"text":"Baley had seen sunlight."},{"id":1677,"text":"He had been in a natural Solarium once in the line of duty."},{"id":1678,"text":"But there, protecting glass had enclosed the place and the sun\u2019s own image had been refracted into a generalized glow."},{"id":1679,"text":"Here, all was open."},{"id":1680,"text":"Automatically, he looked up at the sun, then turned away."},{"id":1681,"text":"His dazzled eyes blinked and watered."},{"id":1682,"text":"A Spacer was approaching."},{"id":1683,"text":"A moment of misgiving struck Baley."},{"id":1684,"text":"R."},{"id":1685,"text":"Daneel, however, stepped forward to greet the approaching man with a handshake."},{"id":1686,"text":"The Spacer turned to Baley and said, \u201cWon\u2019t you come with me, sir?"},{"id":1687,"text":"I am Dr."},{"id":1688,"text":"Han Fastolfe.\u201d\r\n\r\nThings were better inside one of the domes."},{"id":1689,"text":"Baley found himself goggling at the size of the rooms and the way in which space was so carelessly distributed, but was thankful for the feel of the conditioned air."},{"id":1690,"text":"Fastolfe said, sitting down and crossing his long legs, \u201cI\u2019m assuming that you prefer conditioning to unobstructed wind.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe seemed friendly enough."},{"id":1691,"text":"There were fine wrinkles on his forehead and a certain flabbiness to the skin below his eyes and just under his chin."},{"id":1692,"text":"His hair was thinning, but showed no signs of gray."},{"id":1693,"text":"His large ears stood away from his head, giving him a humorous and homely appearance that comforted Baley."},{"id":1694,"text":"Early that morning, Baley had looked once again at those pictures of Spacetown that Enderby had taken."},{"id":1695,"text":"R."},{"id":1696,"text":"Daneel had just arranged the Spacetown appointment and Baley was absorbing the notion that he was to meet Spacers in the flesh."},{"id":1697,"text":"Somehow that was considerably different from speaking to them across miles of carrier wave, as he had done on several occasions before."},{"id":1698,"text":"The Spacers in those pictures had been, generally speaking, like those that were occasionally featured in the book-films: tall, redheaded, grave, coldly handsome."},{"id":1699,"text":"Like R."},{"id":1700,"text":"Daneel Olivaw, for instance."},{"id":1701,"text":"R."},{"id":1702,"text":"Daneel named the Spacers for Baley and when Baley suddenly pointed and said, in surprise, \u201cThat isn\u2019t you, is it?\u201d R."},{"id":1703,"text":"Daneel answered, \u201cNo, Elijah, that is my designer, Dr."},{"id":1704,"text":"Sarton.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe said it unemotionally.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were made in your maker\u2019s image?\u201d asked Baley, sardonically, but there was no answer to that and, in truth, Baley scarcely expected one."},{"id":1705,"text":"The Bible, as he knew, circulated only to the most limited extent on the Outer Worlds."},{"id":1706,"text":"And now Baley looked at Han Fastolfe, a man who deviated very noticeably from the Spacer norm in looks, and the Earthman felt a pronounced gratitude for that fact.\r\n\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t you accept food?\u201d asked Fastolfe."},{"id":1707,"text":"He indicated the table that separated himself and R."},{"id":1708,"text":"Daneel from the Earthman."},{"id":1709,"text":"It bore nothing but a bowl of varicolored spheroids."},{"id":1710,"text":"Baley felt vaguely startled."},{"id":1711,"text":"He had taken them for table decorations."},{"id":1712,"text":"R."},{"id":1713,"text":"Daneel explained. \u201cThese are the fruits of natural plant life grown on Aurora."},{"id":1714,"text":"I suggest you try this kind."},{"id":1715,"text":"It is called an apple and is reputed to be pleasant.\u201d\r\n\r\nFastolfe smiled. \u201cR."},{"id":1716,"text":"Daneel does not know this by personal experience, of course, but he is quite right.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley brought an apple to his mouth."},{"id":1717,"text":"Its surface was red and green."},{"id":1718,"text":"It was cool to the touch and had a faint but pleasant odor."},{"id":1719,"text":"With an effort, he bit into it and the unexpected tartness of the pulpy contents hurt his teeth."},{"id":1720,"text":"He chewed it gingerly."},{"id":1721,"text":"City dwellers ate natural food, of course, whenever rations allowed it."},{"id":1722,"text":"He himself had eaten natural meat and bread often."},{"id":1723,"text":"But such food had always been processed in some way."},{"id":1724,"text":"It had been cooked or ground, blended or compounded."},{"id":1725,"text":"Fruit, now, properly speaking, should come in the form of sauce or preserve."},{"id":1726,"text":"What he was holding now must have come straight from the dirt of a planet\u2019s soil."},{"id":1727,"text":"He thought: I hope they\u2019ve washed it at least."},{"id":1728,"text":"Again he wondered at the spottiness of Spacer notions concerning cleanliness."},{"id":1729,"text":"Fastolfe said, \u201cLet me introduce myself a bit more specifically."},{"id":1730,"text":"I am in charge of the investigation of the murder of Dr."},{"id":1731,"text":"Sarton at the Spacetown end as Commissioner Enderby is at the City end."},{"id":1732,"text":"If I can help you in any way, I stand ready to do so."},{"id":1733,"text":"We are as eager for a quiet solution of the affair and prevention of future incidents of the sort as any of you City men can be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you, Dr."},{"id":1734,"text":"Fastolfe,\u201d said Baley. \u201cYour attitude is appreciated.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo much, he thought, for the amenities."},{"id":1735,"text":"He bit into the center of the apple and hard, dark little ovoids popped into his mouth."},{"id":1736,"text":"He spat automatically."},{"id":1737,"text":"They flew out and fell to the ground."},{"id":1738,"text":"One would have struck Fastolfe\u2019s leg had not the Spacer moved it hastily."},{"id":1739,"text":"Baley reddened, started to bend."},{"id":1740,"text":"Fastolfe said, pleasantly, \u201cIt is quite all right, Mr."},{"id":1741,"text":"Baley."},{"id":1742,"text":"Just leave them, please.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley straightened again."},{"id":1743,"text":"He put the apple down gingerly."},{"id":1744,"text":"He had the uncomfortable feeling that once he was gone, the lost little objects would be found and picked up by suction; the bowl of fruit would be burnt or discarded far from Spacetown; the very room they were sitting in would be sprayed with viricide."},{"id":1745,"text":"He covered his embarrassment with brusqueness."},{"id":1746,"text":"He said, \u201cI would like to ask permission to have Commissioner Enderby join our conference by trimensional personification.\u201d\r\n\r\nFastolfe\u2019s eyebrows raised. \u201cCertainly, if you wish it."},{"id":1747,"text":"Daneel, would you make the connection?\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley sat in stiff discomfort until the shiny surface of the large parallel piped in one corner of the room dissolved away to show Commissioner Julius Enderby and part of his desk."},{"id":1748,"text":"At that moment, the discomfort eased and Baley felt nothing short of love for that familiar figure, and a longing to be safely back in that office with him, or anywhere in the City, for that matter."},{"id":1749,"text":"Even in the least prepossessing portion of the Jersey yeast-vat districts."},{"id":1750,"text":"Now that he had his witness, Baley saw no reason for delay."},{"id":1751,"text":"He said, \u201cI believe I have penetrated the mystery surrounding the death of Dr."},{"id":1752,"text":"Sarton.\u201d\r\n\r\nOut of the corner of his eye, he saw Enderby springing to his feet and grabbing wildly (and successfully) at his flying spectacles."},{"id":1753,"text":"By standing, the Commissioner thrust his head out of the limits of the trimensic receiver and was forced to sit down again, red-faced and speechless."},{"id":1754,"text":"In a much quieter way, Dr."},{"id":1755,"text":"Fastolfe, head inclined to one side, was as startled."},{"id":1756,"text":"Only R."},{"id":1757,"text":"Daneel was unmoved.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you mean,\u201d said Fastolfe, \u201cthat you know the murderer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Baley, \u201cI mean there was no murder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d screamed Enderby.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne moment, Commissioner Enderby,\u201d said Fastolfe, raising a hand."},{"id":1758,"text":"His eyes held Baley\u2019s and he said, \u201cDo you mean that Dr."},{"id":1759,"text":"Sarton is alive?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, sir, and I believe I know where he is.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRight there,\u201d said Baley, and pointed firmly at R."},{"id":1760,"text":"Daneel Olivaw."},{"id":1761,"text":"Chapter 8\r\n\r\n\r\nDEBATE OVER A ROBOT\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Baley was most conscious of the thud of his own pulse."},{"id":1762,"text":"He seemed to be living in a moment of suspended time."},{"id":1763,"text":"R."},{"id":1764,"text":"Daneel\u2019s expression was, as always, empty of emotion."},{"id":1765,"text":"Han Fastolfe wore a look of well-bred astonishment on his face and nothing more."},{"id":1766,"text":"It was Commissioner Julius Enderby\u2019s reaction that most concerned Baley, however."},{"id":1767,"text":"The trimensic receiver out of which his face stared did not allow of perfect reproduction."},{"id":1768,"text":"There was always that tiny flicker and that not-quite-ideal resolution."},{"id":1769,"text":"Through that imperfection and through the further masking of the Commissioner\u2019s spectacles, Enderby\u2019s eyes were unreadable."},{"id":1770,"text":"Baley thought: Don\u2019t go to pieces on me, Julius."},{"id":1771,"text":"I need you."},{"id":1772,"text":"He didn\u2019t really think that Fastolfe would act in haste or under emotional impulse."},{"id":1773,"text":"He had read somewhere once that Spacers had no religion, but substituted, instead, a cold and phlegmatic intellectualism raised to the heights of a philosophy."},{"id":1774,"text":"He believed that and counted on it."},{"id":1775,"text":"They would make a point of acting slowly and then only on the basis of reason."},{"id":1776,"text":"If he were alone among them and had said what he had said, he was certain that he would never have returned to the City."},{"id":1777,"text":"Cold reason would have dictated that."},{"id":1778,"text":"The Spacers\u2019 plans were worth more to them, many times over, than the life of a City dweller."},{"id":1779,"text":"There would be some excuse made to Julius Enderby."},{"id":1780,"text":"Maybe they would present his corpse to the Commissioner, shake their heads, and speak of an Earthman conspiracy having struck again."},{"id":1781,"text":"The Commissioner would believe them."},{"id":1782,"text":"It was the way he was built."},{"id":1783,"text":"If he hated Spacers, it was a hatred based on fear."},{"id":1784,"text":"He wouldn\u2019t dare disbelieve them."},{"id":1785,"text":"That was why he had to be an actual witness of events, a witness, moreover, safely out of reach of the Spacers\u2019 calculated safety measures."},{"id":1786,"text":"The Commissioner said, chokingly, \u201cLije, you\u2019re all wrong."},{"id":1787,"text":"I saw Dr."},{"id":1788,"text":"Sarton\u2019s corpse.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou saw the charred remnants of something you were told was Dr."},{"id":1789,"text":"Sarton\u2019s corpse,\u201d retorted Baley, boldly."},{"id":1790,"text":"He thought grimly of the Commissioner\u2019s broken glasses."},{"id":1791,"text":"That had been an unexpected favor for the Spacers.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no,

R."},{"id":1880,"text":"Daneel, now."},{"id":1881,"text":"Justice is a very concrete term to him since it is based on law enforcement, which is in turn based upon the existence of specific and definite laws."},{"id":1882,"text":"There is nothing abstract about it."},{"id":1883,"text":"A human being can recognize the fact that, on the basis of an abstract moral code, some laws may be bad

set up a duo-beam."},{"id":1928,"text":"The custom of absolute privacy in the Personals is very strong and other men would not even look at him."},{"id":1929,"text":"The Section Personal is quite close to Elijah\u2019s apartment, so that the distance factor is not important."},{"id":1930,"text":"A suitcase model could be used."},{"id":1931,"text":"I went to the Personal to

hours."},{"id":1939,"text":"So the fact that he was a robot could not have leaked out through spying on our last evening\u2019s conversation.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNevertheless,\u201d said Dr."},{"id":1940,"text":"Fastolfe, \u201chis action last night of going to the Personal stands explained, I think.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut something is brought up that is not explained,\u201d retorted

half an hour or more before we went to my apartment."},{"id":1946,"text":"During that time, we two were completely out of contact with one another."},{"id":1947,"text":"It was then that you got in

night."},{"id":1953,"text":"You know damn well how unlikely that is.\r\n\r\n\u201cNext they send a supposed robot into the City; in fact, they insist on sending him."},{"id":1954,"text":"The first thing the robot does is to threaten a crowd of human beings with a blaster."},{"id":1955,"text":"The second is to set in motion the rumor that there is a Spacer robot in the City."},{"id":1956,"text":"In fact, the rumor is so specific that Jessie told me it was known that he was working with the police."},{"id":1957,"text":"That means that before long it will be known that it was the robot who handled the blaster."},{"id":1958,"text":"Maybe even now the rumor is spreading across the yeast-vat country and down the Long Island hydroponic plants that there\u2019s a

what\u2019s happening, Commissioner."},{"id":1961,"text":"Don\u2019t you see it?"},{"id":1962,"text":"There\u2019s a conspiracy in the City, all right, but it\u2019s run from Spacetown."},{"id":1963,"text":"The Spacers want to be able to report a murder."},{"id":1964,"text":"They want riots."},{"id":1965,"text":"They want an assault on Spacetown."},{"id":1966,"text":"The worse things get, the better the incident--and Spacer ships come down and occupy the Cities of Earth.\u201d\r\n\r\nFastolfe said, mildly, \u201cWe had an excuse in the Barrier Riots of twenty-five

Enderby."},{"id":2106,"text":"The least he could expect was demotion, and that was bad enough."},{"id":2107,"text":"The mere act of living in a modern City insured the bare possibility of existence,

based on money."},{"id":2118,"text":"The competitive struggle for existence, they said, was brutal."},{"id":2119,"text":"No truly complex society could be maintained because of the strains introduced

politician."},{"id":2142,"text":"He tells us what we want to hear."},{"id":2143,"text":"He handles us, if you know what I mean."},{"id":2144,"text":"Now you came here and boldly accused us of tremendous crimes and tried to prove your case."},{"id":2145,"text":"I enjoyed the process."},{"id":2146,"text":"I found it a hopeful development.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow hopeful?\u201d asked Baley

\u201cFourteen-forty-five.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Commissioner could be back any minute."},{"id":3569,"text":"Look, commandeer a squad car and we can talk about this in the motorway.\u201d\r\n\r\nJessie\u2019s head jerked upright. \u201cThe motorway?"},{"id":3570,"text":"Oh, no, Lije.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe said, in as soothing a tone as he could manage, \u201cNow, Jessie, don\u2019t be superstitious."},{"id":3571,"text":"You can\u2019t go on the expressway the way you are."},{"id":3572,"text":"Be a good girl and calm down or we won\u2019t even be able to go through the common room."},{"id":3573,"text":"I\u2019ll get you some water.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe wiped her face with a damp handkerchief and said drearily, \u201cOh, look at my makeup.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about your makeup,\u201d said Baley. \u201cDaneel, what about the squad car?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s waiting for us now, partner Elijah.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome on, Jessie.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait."},{"id":3574,"text":"Wait just a minute, Lije."},{"id":3575,"text":"I\u2019ve got to do something to my face.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut she twisted away. \u201cPlease."},{"id":3576,"text":"I can\u2019t go through the common room like this."},{"id":3577,"text":"I won\u2019t take a second.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe man and the robot waited, the man with little jerky clenchings of his fists, the robot impassively."},{"id":3578,"text":"Jessie rummaged through her purse for the necessary equipment. (If there were one thing, Baley had once said solemnly, that had resisted mechanical improvement since Medieval times, it was a woman\u2019s purse."},{"id":3579,"text":"Even the substitution of magnetic clotures for metal clasps had not proven successful.) Jessie pulled out a small mirror and the silver-cased cosmetokit that Baley had bought her on the occasion of three birthdays before."},{"id":3580,"text":"The cosmetokit had several orifices and she used each in turn."},{"id":3581,"text":"All but the last spray were invisible."},{"id":3582,"text":"She used them with that fineness of touch and delicacy of control that seems to be the birthright of women even at times of the greatest stress."},{"id":3583,"text":"The base went on first in a smooth even layer that removed all shininess and roughness from the skin and left it with the faintly golden glow which long experience had taught Jessie was just the shade most suited to the natural coloring of her hair and eyes."},{"id":3584,"text":"Then the touch of tan along the forehead and chin, a gentle brush of rouge on either cheek, tracing back to the angle of the jaw; and a delicate drift of blue on the upper eyelids and along the earlobes."},{"id":3585,"text":"Finally there was the application of the smooth carmine to the lips."},{"id":3586,"text":"That involved the one visible spray, a faintly pink mist that glistened liquidly in air, but dried and deepened richly on contact with the lips.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d said Jessie, with several swift pats at her hair and a look of deep dissatisfaction. \u201cI suppose that will do.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe process had taken more than the promised second, but less than fifteen seconds."},{"id":3587,"text":"Nevertheless, it had seemed interminable to Baley.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d he said."},{"id":3588,"text":"She barely had time to return the cosmetokit to the purse before he had pushed her through the door."},{"id":3589,"text":"The eerie silence of the motorway lay thick on either side."},{"id":3590,"text":"Baley said, \u201cAll right, Jessie.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe impassivity that had covered Jessie\u2019s face since they first left the Commissioner\u2019s office showed signs of cracking."},{"id":3591,"text":"She looked at her husband and at Daneel with a helpless silence."},{"id":3592,"text":"Baley said, \u201cGet it over with, Jessie."},{"id":3593,"text":"Please."},{"id":3594,"text":"Have you committed a crime?"},{"id":3595,"text":"An actual crime?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA crime?\u201d She shook her head uncertainly.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow hold on to yourself."},{"id":3596,"text":"No hysterics."},{"id":3597,"text":"Just say yes or no, Jessie."},{"id":3598,"text":"Have you--\u201d he hesitated a trifle, \u201ckilled anyone?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe look on Jessie\u2019s face was promptly transmuted to indignation. \u201cWhy, Lije Baley!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes or no, Jessie.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe hard knot in Baley\u2019s stomach softened perceptibly. \u201cHave you stolen anything?"},{"id":3599,"text":"Falsified ration data?"},{"id":3600,"text":"Assaulted anyone?"},{"id":3601,"text":"Destroyed property?"},{"id":3602,"text":"Speak up, Jessie.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything--anything specific."},{"id":3603,"text":"I didn\u2019t mean anything like that.\u201d She looked over her shoulder. \u201cLije, do we have to stay down here?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRight here until this is over."},{"id":3604,"text":"Now, start at the beginning."},{"id":3605,"text":"What did you come to tell us?\u201d Over Jessie\u2019s bowed head, Baley\u2019s eyes met R."},{"id":3606,"text":"Daneel\u2019s."},{"id":3607,"text":"Jessie spoke in a soft voice that gained in strength and articulateness as she went on.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s these people, these Medievalists; you know, Lije."},{"id":3608,"text":"They\u2019re always around, always talking."},{"id":3609,"text":"Even in the old days when I was an assistant dietitian, it was like that."},{"id":3610,"text":"Remember Elizabeth Thornbowe?"},{"id":3611,"text":"She was a Medievalist."},{"id":3612,"text":"She was always talking about how all our troubles came from the City and how things were better before the Cities started.\r\n\r\n\u201cI used to ask her how she was so sure that was so, especially after you and I met, Lije (remember the talks we used to have), and then she would quote from those small book-reels that are always floating around."},{"id":3613,"text":"You know, like Shame of the Cities that the fellow wrote."},{"id":3614,"text":"I don\u2019t remember his name.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley said, absently, \u201cOgninsky.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, only most of them were lots worse."},{"id":3615,"text":"Then, when I married you, she was really sarcastic."},{"id":3616,"text":"She said, \u2018I suppose you\u2019re going to be a real City woman now that you\u2019ve married a policeman.\u2019 After that, she didn\u2019t talk to me much and then I quit the job and that was that."},{"id":3617,"text":"Lots of things she used to say were just to shock me, I think, or to make herself look mysterious and glamorous."},{"id":3618,"text":"She was an old maid, you know; never got married till the day she died."},{"id":3619,"text":"Lots of those Medievalists don\u2019t fit in, one way or another."},{"id":3620,"text":"Remember, you once said, Lije, that people sometimes mistake their own shortcomings for those of society and want to fix the Cities because they don\u2019t know how to fix themselves.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley remembered, and his words now sounded flip and superficial in his own ears."},{"id":3621,"text":"He said, gently, \u201cKeep to the point, Jessie.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe went on, \u201cAnyway, Lizzy was always talking about how there\u2019d come a day and people had to get together."},{"id":3622,"text":"She said it was all the fault of the Spacers because they wanted to keep Earth weak and decadent."},{"id":3623,"text":"That was one of her favorite words, \u2018decadent.\u2019 She\u2019d look at the menus I\u2019d prepare for the next week and sniff and say, \u2018Decadent, decadent.\u2019 Jane Myers used to imitate her in the cook room and we\u2019d die laughing."},{"id":3624,"text":"She said, Elizabeth did, that someday we were going to break up the Cities and go back to the soil and have an accounting with the Spacers who were trying to tie us forever to the Cities by forcing robots on us."},{"id":3625,"text":"Only she never called them robots."},{"id":3626,"text":"She used to say \u2018soulless monster-machines,\u2019 if you\u2019ll excuse the expression, Daneel.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe robot said, \u201cI am not aware of the significance of the adjective you used, Jessie, but in any case, the expression is excused."},{"id":3627,"text":"Please go on.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley stirred restlessly."},{"id":3628,"text":"It was that way with Jessie."},{"id":3629,"text":"No emergency, H no crisis could make her tell a story in any way but her own circuitous one."},{"id":3630,"text":"She said, \u201cElizabeth always tried to talk as though there were lots of people in it with her."},{"id":3631,"text":"She would say, \u2018At the last meeting,\u2019 and then stop and look at me sort of half proud and half scared as though she wanted me to ask about it so she could look important, and yet scared I might get her in trouble."},{"id":3632,"text":"Of course, I never asked her."},{"id":3633,"text":"I wouldn\u2019t give her the satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnyway, after I married you, Lije, it was all over, until--\u201d She stopped.\r\n\r\n\u201cGo on, Jessie,\u201d said Baley.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou remember, Lije, that argument we had?"},{"id":3634,"text":"About Jezebel, I mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d It took a second or two for Baley to remember that it was Jessie\u2019s own name, and not a reference to another woman."},{"id":3635,"text":"He turned to R."},{"id":3636,"text":"Daneel in an automatically defensive explanation.\r\n\r\n\u201cJessie\u2019s full name is Jezebel."},{"id":3637,"text":"She is not fond of it and doesn\u2019t use it.\u201d\r\n\r\nR."},{"id":3638,"text":"Daneel nodded gravely and Baley thought: Jehoshaphat, why waste worry on him?\r\n\r\n\u201cIt bothered me a lot, Lije,\u201d Jessie said. \u201cIt really did."},{"id":3639,"text":"I guess it was silly, but I kept thinking and thinking about what you said."},{"id":3640,"text":"I mean about your saying that Jezebel was only a conservative who fought for the ways of her ancestors against the strange ways the newcomers had brought."},{"id":3641,"text":"After all, I was Jezebel and I always ...\u201d\r\n\r\nShe groped for a word and Baley supplied it. \u201cIdentified yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d But she shook her head almost immediately and looked away. \u201cNot really, of course."},{"id":3642,"text":"Not literally."},{"id":3643,"text":"The way I thought she was, you know."},{"id":3644,"text":"I wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know that, Jessie."},{"id":3645,"text":"Don\u2019t be foolish.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut still I thought of her a lot and, somehow, I got to thinking, it\u2019s just the same now as it was then."},{"id":3646,"text":"I mean, we Earth people had our old ways and here were the Spacers coming in with a lot of new ways and trying to encourage the new ways we had stumbled into ourselves and maybe the Medievalists were right."},{"id":3647,"text":"Maybe we should go back to our old, good ways."},{"id":3648,"text":"So I went back and found Elizabeth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes."},{"id":3649,"text":"Go on.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe said she didn\u2019t know what I was talking about and besides I was a cop\u2019s wife."},{"id":3650,"text":"I said that had nothing to do with it and finally she said, well, she\u2019d speak to somebody, and then about a month later she came to me and said it was all right and I joined and I\u2019ve been at meetings ever since.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley looked at her sadly. \u201cAnd you never told me?\u201d\r\n\r\nJessie\u2019s voice trembled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lije.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, that won\u2019t help."},{"id":3651,"text":"Being sorry, I mean."},{"id":3652,"text":"I want to know about the meetings."},{"id":3653,"text":"In the first place, where were they held?\u201d\r\n\r\nA sense of detachment was creeping over him, a numbing of emotions."},{"id":3654,"text":"What he had tried not to believe was so, was openly so, was unmistakably so."},{"id":3655,"text":"In a sense, it was a relief to have the uncertainty over."},{"id":3656,"text":"She said, \u201cDown here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDown here?"},{"id":3657,"text":"You mean on this spot?"},{"id":3658,"text":"What do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHere in the motorway."},{"id":3659,"text":"That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to come down here."},{"id":3660,"text":"It was a wonderful place to meet, though."},{"id":3661,"text":"We\u2019d get together--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow many?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure."},{"id":3662,"text":"About sixty or seventy."},{"id":3663,"text":"It was just a sort of local branch."},{"id":3664,"text":"There\u2019d be folding chairs and some refreshments and someone would make a speech, mostly about how wonderful life was in the old days and how someday we\u2019d do away with the monsters, the robots, that is, and the Spacers, too."},{"id":3665,"text":"The speeches were sort of dull really, because they were all the same."},{"id":3666,"text":"We just endured them."},{"id":3667,"text":"Mostly, it was the fun of getting together and feeling important."},{"id":3668,"text":"We would pledge ourselves to oaths and there\u2019d be secret ways we could greet each other on the outside.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you ever interrupted?"},{"id":3669,"text":"No squad cars or fire engines passed?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo."},{"id":3670,"text":"Never.\u201d\r\n\r\nR."},{"id":3671,"text":"Daneel interrupted, \u201cIs that unusual, Elijah?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe not,\u201d Baley answered thoughtfully. \u201cThere are some side passages that are practically never used."},{"id":3672,"text":"It\u2019s quite a trick, knowing which they are, though."},{"id":3673,"text":"Is that all you did at the meetings, Jessie?"},{"id":3674,"text":"Make speeches and play at conspiracy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about all."},{"id":3675,"text":"And sing songs, sometimes."},{"id":3676,"text":"And of course, refreshments."},{"id":3677,"text":"Not much."},{"id":3678,"text":"Sandwiches, usually, and juice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d he said, almost brutally, \u201cwhat\u2019s bothering you now?\u201d\r\n\r\nJessie winced. \u201cYou\u2019re angry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease,\u201d said Baley, with iron patience, \u201canswer my question."},{"id":3679,"text":"If it were all as harmless as that, why have you been in such a panic for the last day and a half?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought they would hurt you, Lije."},{"id":3680,"text":"For heaven\u2019s sake, why do you act as though you don\u2019t understand?"},{"id":3681,"text":"I\u2019ve explained it to you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t."},{"id":3682,"text":"Not yet."},{"id":3683,"text":"You\u2019ve told me about a harmless little secret kaffee-klatsch you belonged to."},{"id":3684,"text":"Did they ever hold open demonstrations?"},{"id":3685,"text":"Did they ever destroy robots?"},{"id":3686,"text":"Start riots?"},{"id":3687,"text":"Kill people?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever!"},{"id":3688,"text":"Lije, I wouldn\u2019t do any of those things."},{"id":3689,"text":"I wouldn\u2019t stay a member if they tried it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, then, why do you say you\u2019ve done a terrible thing?"},{"id":3690,"text":"Why do you expect to be sent to jail?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell ..."},{"id":3691,"text":"Well, they used to talk about someday when they\u2019d put pressure on the government."},{"id":3692,"text":"We were supposed to get organized and then afterward there would be huge strikes and work stoppages."},{"id":3693,"text":"We could force the government to ban all robots and make the Spacers go back where they came from."},{"id":3694,"text":"I thought it was just talk and then, this thing started; about you and Daneel, I mean."},{"id":3695,"text":"Then they said, \u2018Now we\u2019ll see action,\u2019 and \u2018We\u2019re going to make an example of them and put a stop to the robot invasion right now.\u2019 Right there in Personal they said it, not knowing it was you they were talking about."},{"id":3696,"text":"But I knew."},{"id":3697,"text":"Right away.\u201d\r\n\r\nHer voice broke."},{"id":3698,"text":"Baley softened. \u201cCome on, Jessie."},{"id":3699,"text":"It was all nothing."},{"id":3700,"text":"It was just talk."},{"id":3701,"text":"You can see for yourself that nothing has happened.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI was so--so suh--scared."},{"id":3702,"text":"And I thought: I\u2019m part of it."},{"id":3703,"text":"If there were going to be killing and destruction, you might be killed and Bentley and somehow it would be all muh--my fault for taking part in it, and I ought to be sent to jail.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley let her sob herself out."},{"id":3704,"text":"He put his arm about her shoulder and stared tight-lipped at R."},{"id":3705,"text":"Daneel, who gazed calmly back."},{"id":3706,"text":"He said, \u201cNow, I want you to think, Jessie."},{"id":3707,"text":"Who was the head of your group?\u201d\r\n\r\nShe was quieter now, patting the corners of her eyes with a handkerchief. \u201cA man called Joseph Klemin was the leader, but he wasn\u2019t really anybody."},{"id":3708,"text":"He wasn\u2019t more than five feet four inches tall and I think he was terribly henpecked at home."},{"id":3709,"text":"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any harm in him."},{"id":3710,"text":"You aren\u2019t going to arrest him, are you, Lije?"},{"id":3711,"text":"On my say-so?\u201d She looked guiltily troubled.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not arresting anyone just yet."},{"id":3712,"text":"How did Klemin get his instructions?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid any strangers come to meeting?"},{"id":3713,"text":"You know what I mean: big shots from Central Headquarters?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSometimes people would come to make speeches."},{"id":3714,"text":"That wasn\u2019t very often, maybe twice a year or so.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you name them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo."},{"id":3715,"text":"They were always just introduced as \u2018one of us\u2019 or \u2018a friend from Jackson Heights\u2019 or wherever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI see."},{"id":3716,"text":"Daneel!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, Elijah,\u201d said R."},{"id":3717,"text":"Daneel.\r\n\r\n\u201cDescribe the men you think you\u2019ve tabbed."},{"id":3718,"text":"We\u2019ll see if Jessie can recognize them.\u201d\r\n\r\nR."},{"id":3719,"text":"Daneel went through the list with clinical exactness."},{"id":3720,"text":"Jessie listened with an expression of dismay as the categories of physical measurements lengthened and shook her head with increasing firmness.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use."},{"id":3721,"text":"It\u2019s no use,\u201d she cried. \u201cHow can I remember?"},{"id":3722,"text":"I can\u2019t remember how any of them looked."},{"id":3723,"text":"I can\u2019t--\u201d\r\n\r\nShe stopped, and seemed to consider."},{"id":3724,"text":"Then she said, \u201cDid you say one of them was a yeast farmer?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFrancis Clousarr,\u201d said R."},{"id":3725,"text":"Daneel, \u201cis an employee at New York Yeast.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, you know, once a man was making a speech and I happened to be sitting in the first row and I kept getting a whiff, just a whiff, really, of raw yeast smell."},{"id":3726,"text":"You know what I mean."},{"id":3727,"text":"The only reason that I remember is that I had an upset stomach that day and the smell kept making me sick."},{"id":3728,"text":"I had to stand up and move to the back and of

there."},{"id":4309,"text":"It seems obvious to me that the reason for that was to have the method of murder unmistakable."},{"id":4310,"text":"Even if everyone was so infantile as not to recognize the alpha-sprayer immediately, someone would be bound to notice fogged photographic film in fairly short order.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow does that all relate to you, Elijah?\u201d\r\n\r\nBailey grinned tightly, his long face completely devoid of humor. \u201cVery neatly."},{"id":4311,"text":"The alpha-sprayer was taken from the Williamsburg power plant."},{"id":4312,"text":"You and I passed through the Williamsburg power plant yesterday."},{"id":4313,"text":"We were seen, and the fact will come out."},{"id":4314,"text":"That gives me opportunity to get the weapon as well as motive for the

R."},{"id":4335,"text":"Daneel was shaking his head."},{"id":4336,"text":"The robot said, \u201cI am sorry, Elijah\u201d--there was no trace of sorrow on his face, of course--\u201cbut I anticipated

everything."},{"id":4348,"text":"He kept his voice painfully steady as he reached for his pipe and for the little bag that held his precious crumbs of tobacco."},{"id":4349,"text":"He said, \u201cWhat\u2019s it all about, Daneel?\u201d\r\n\r\nR."},{"id":4350,"text":"Daneel said, \u201cDo you not understand?"},{"id":4351,"text":"Is it not obvious?\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley said, patiently, \u201cI do not understand."},{"id":4352,"text":"It is not obvious.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are here,\u201d said the robot, \u201cand by we, I mean our people at Spacetown, to break the shell surrounding Earth and force its people into new expansion and colonization.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know that."},{"id":4353,"text":"Please don\u2019t labor the point.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI must, since it is the essential one."},{"id":4354,"text":"If we were anxious to exact punishment for the murder of Dr."},{"id":4355,"text":"Sarton, it was not that in doing so we expected to bring Dr."},{"id":4356,"text":"Sarton back to life, you understand; it was only that failure to do so would strengthen the position of our home planet politicians who are against the very idea of Spacetown.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut now,\u201d said Baley, with sudden violence, \u201cyou say you\u2019re getting ready to go home of your own accord."},{"id":4357,"text":"Why?"},{"id":4358,"text":"In heaven\u2019s name, why?"},{"id":4359,"text":"The answer to the Sarton case is close."},{"id":4360,"text":"It must be close or they wouldn\u2019t be trying so hard to blast me out of the investigation."},{"id":4361,"text":"I have a feeling I have all the facts I need to work out the answer."},{"id":4362,"text":"It must be in here somewhere.\u201d He knuckled his temple wildly. \u201cA

was making a weak spectacle of himself before a cold and unimpressed machine that could only stare at him silently."},{"id":4368,"text":"He said harshly, \u201cWell, never mind that."},{"id":4369,"text":"Why are the Spacers breaking off?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe robot said, \u201cOur project is concluded."},{"id":4370,"text":"We are satisfied that Earth will colonize.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve switched to optimism then?\u201d The plain-clothes man drew in his first calming puff of tobacco smoke and felt his grip upon his own emotions grow firmer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have."},{"id":4371,"text":"For a long time now, we of Spacetown have tried to change Earth by changing its economy."},{"id":4372,"text":"We have tried to introduce our own C\/Fe

failed."},{"id":4375,"text":"The harder we tried, the stronger the opposing party of the Medievalists grew.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI know all this,\u201d said Baley."},{"id":4376,"text":"He thought: No use."},{"id":4377,"text":"He\u2019s got to tell this in his own way, like a field recording."},{"id":4378,"text":"He yelled silently at R."},{"id":4379,"text":"Daneel:

first find a segment of Earth\u2019s population that desired what we desired or could be persuaded to do so."},{"id":4384,"text":"By encouraging and helping them, we could make the movement a native one rather than a foreign one."},{"id":4385,"text":"The difficulty was in finding the native element best suited for our purposes."},{"id":4386,"text":"You, yourself, Elijah, were an interesting experiment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI?"},{"id":4387,"text":"I?"},{"id":4388,"text":"What do you mean?\u201d demanded Baley.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were glad your Commissioner recommended you."},{"id":4389,"text":"From your psychic profile we judged you to be a useful specimen."},{"id":4390,"text":"Cerebroanalysis, a process I conducted upon you as soon as I met you, confirmed our judgment."},{"id":4391,"text":"You are a practical man, Elijah."},{"id":4392,"text":"You do not moon romantically over Earth\u2019s past, despite your healthy interest in it."},{"id":4393,"text":"Nor do you stubbornly embrace the City culture of Earth\u2019s present day."},{"id":4394,"text":"We felt that people such as yourself were the ones that could lead Earthmen to the stars once more."},{"id":4395,"text":"It was one reason Dr."},{"id":4396,"text":"Fastolfe was anxious to see you yesterday morning.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo be sure, your practical nature was embarrassingly intense."},{"id":4397,"text":"You refused to understand that the fanatical service of an ideal, even a mistaken ideal, could make a man do things quite beyond his ordinary capacity, as, for instance, crossing open country at night to destroy someone he considered an archenemy of his cause."},{"id":4398,"text":"We were not overly surprised, therefore, that you were stubborn enough and daring enough to attempt to prove the murder a fraud."},{"id":4399,"text":"In a way, it proved you were the man we wanted for our experiment.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, what experiment?\u201d Baley brought his fist down on the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe experiment of persuading you that colonization was the answer to Earth\u2019s problems.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I was persuaded."},{"id":4400,"text":"I\u2019ll grant you that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, under the influence of the appropriate drug.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley\u2019s teeth loosened their grip on his pipestem."},{"id":4401,"text":"He caught the pipe as it fell."},{"id":4402,"text":"Once again, he was seeing that scene in the Spacetown dome."},{"id":4403,"text":"Himself swimming back to awareness after the shock of learning that R."},{"id":4404,"text":"Daneel was a robot after all; R."},{"id":4405,"text":"Daneel\u2019s smooth fingers pinching up the flesh of his arm; a hypo-shiver standing out darkly under his skin and then fading away."},{"id":4406,"text":"He said, chokingly, \u201cWhat was in the hypo-shiver?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing that need alarm you, Elijah."},{"id":4407,"text":"It was a mild drug intended only to make your mind more receptive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so I believed whatever was told me."},{"id":4408,"text":"Is that it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot quite."},{"id":4409,"text":"You would not believe anything that was foreign to the basic pattern of your thought."},{"id":4410,"text":"In fact, the results of the experiment were disappointing."},{"id":4411,"text":"Dr."},{"id":4412,"text":"Fastolfe had hoped you would become fanatical and single-minded on the subject."},{"id":4413,"text":"Instead you became rather distantly approving, no more."},{"id":4414,"text":"Your practical nature stood in the way of anything further."},{"id":4415,"text":"It made us realize that our only hope was the romantics after all, and the romantics, unfortunately, were all Medievalists, actual or potential.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley felt incongruously proud of himself, glad of his stubbornness, and happy that he had disappointed them."},{"id":4416,"text":"Let them experiment with someone else."},{"id":4417,"text":"He grinned savagely. \u201cAnd so now you\u2019ve given up and are going home?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that is not it."},{"id":4418,"text":"I said a few moments ago that we were satisfied Earth would colonize."},{"id":4419,"text":"It was you that gave us the answer.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI gave it to you?"},{"id":4420,"text":"How?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou spoke to Francis Clousarr of the advantages of colonization."},{"id":4421,"text":"You spoke rather fervently, I judge."},{"id":4422,"text":"At least our experiment on you had that result."},{"id":4423,"text":"And Clousarr\u2019s cerebroanalytic properties changed."},{"id":4424,"text":"Very subtly, to be sure, but they changed.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean I convinced him that I was right?"},{"id":4425,"text":"I don\u2019t believe that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, conviction does not come that easily."},{"id":4426,"text":"But the cerebroanalytic changes demonstrated conclusively that the Medievalist mind is open to that sort of conviction."},{"id":4427,"text":"I experimented further myself."},{"id":4428,"text":"When leaving Yeast-town, guessing what might have happened between you two from his cerebric changes, I made the proposition of a school for emigrants as a way of insuring his children\u2019s future."},{"id":4429,"text":"He rejected that, but again his aura changed, and it seemed to me quite obvious that it was the proper method of attack.\u201d\r\n\r\nR."},{"id":4430,"text":"Daneel paused, then spoke on.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe thing called Medievalism shows a craving for pioneering."},{"id":4431,"text":"To be sure, the direction in which that craving turns itself is toward Earth itself, which is near and which has the precedent of a great past."},{"id":4432,"text":"But the vision of worlds beyond is a similar something and the romantic can turn to it easily, just as Clousarr felt the attraction as a result of one lecture from you.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you see, we of Spacetown had already succeeded without knowing it."},{"id":4433,"text":"We ourselves, rather than anything we tried to introduce, were the unsettling factor."},{"id":4434,"text":"We crystallized the romantic impulses on Earth into Medievalism and induced an organization in them."},{"id":4435,"text":"After all, it is the Medievalist who wishes to break the cake of custom, not the City officials who have most to gain from preserving the status quo."},{"id":4436,"text":"If we leave Spacetown now, if we do not irritate the Medievalist by our continued presence until he has committed himself to Earth, and only Earth, past redemption, if we leave behind a few obscure individuals or robots such as myself who, together with sympathetic Earthmen such as yourself, can establish the training schools for emigrants that I spoke of, the Medievalist will eventually turn away from Earth."},{"id":4437,"text":"He will need robots and will either get them from us or build his own."},{"id":4438,"text":"He will develop a C\/Fe culture to suit himself.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was a long speech for R."},{"id":4439,"text":"Daneel."},{"id":4440,"text":"He must have realized that himself, for, after another pause, he said, \u201cI tell you all this to explain why it is necessary to do something that may hurt you.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley thought bitterly: A robot must not hurt a human being, unless he can think of a way to prove it is for the human being\u2019s ultimate good after all."},{"id":4441,"text":"Baley said, \u201cJust a minute."},{"id":4442,"text":"Let me introduce a practical note."},{"id":4443,"text":"You\u2019ll go back to your worlds and say that an Earthman killed a Spacer and is unpunished."},{"id":4444,"text":"The Outer Worlds will demand an indemnity from Earth, and I warn you, Earth is no longer in a mood to endure such treatment."},{"id":4445,"text":"There will be trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am sure that will not happen, Elijah."},{"id":4446,"text":"The elements on our planets that would be most interested in pressing for an indemnity would be also most interested in forcing an end to Spacetown."},{"id":4447,"text":"We can easily offer the latter as an inducement to abandon the former."},{"id":4448,"text":"It is what we plan to do, anyway."},{"id":4449,"text":"Earth will be left in peace.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd Baley broke out, his voice hoarse with sudden despair, \u201cAnd where does that leave me?"},{"id":4450,"text":"The Commissioner will drop the Sarton investigation at once if Spacetown is willing, but the R."},{"id":4451,"text":"Sammy thing will have to continue, since it points to corruption inside the Department."},{"id":4452,"text":"He\u2019ll be in any minute with a ream of evidence against me."},{"id":4453,"text":"I know that."},{"id":4454,"text":"It\u2019s been arranged."},{"id":4455,"text":"I\u2019ll be declassified, Daneel."},{"id":4456,"text":"There\u2019s Jessie to consider."},{"id":4457,"text":"She\u2019ll be smeared as a criminal."},{"id":4458,"text":"There\u2019s Bentley--\u201d\r\n\r\nR."},{"id":4459,"text":"Daneel said, \u201cYou must not think, Elijah, that I do not understand the position in which you find yourself."},{"id":4460,"text":"In the service of humanity\u2019s good, the minor wrongs must be tolerated."},{"id":4461,"text":"Dr."},{"id":4462,"text":"Sarton has a surviving wife, two children, parents, a sister, many friends."},{"id":4463,"text":"All must grieve at his death and be saddened at the thought that his murderer has not been found and punished.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen why not stay and find him?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is no longer necessary.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley said, bitterly, \u201cWhy not admit that the entire investigation was an excuse to study us under field conditions?"},{"id":4464,"text":"You never gave a damn who killed Dr."},{"id":4465,"text":"Sarton.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe would have liked to know,\u201d said R."},{"id":4466,"text":"Daneel, coolly, \u201cbut we were never under any delusions as to which was more important, an individual or humanity."},{"id":4467,"text":"To continue the investigation now would involve interfering with a situation which we now find satisfactory."},{"id":4468,"text":"We could not foretell what damage we might do.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean the murderer might turn out to be a prominent Medievalist and right now the Spacers don\u2019t want to do anything to antagonize their new friends.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not as I would say it, but there is truth in your words.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your justice circuit, Daneel?"},{"id":4469,"text":"Is this justice?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are degrees of justice, Elijah."},{"id":4470,"text":"When the lesser is incompatible with the greater, the lesser must give way.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was as though Baley\u2019s mind were circling the impregnable logic of R."},{"id":4471,"text":"Daneel\u2019s positronic brain, searching for a loophole, a weakness."},{"id":4472,"text":"He said, \u201cHave you no personal curiosity, Daneel?"},{"id":4473,"text":"You\u2019ve called yourself a detective."},{"id":4474,"text":"Do you know what that implies?"},{"id":4475,"text":"Do you understand that an investigation is more than a job of work?"},{"id":4476,"text":"It is a challenge."},{"id":4477,"text":"Your mind is pitted against that of the criminal."},{"id":4478,"text":"It is a clash of intellect."},{"id":4479,"text":"Can you abandon the battle and admit defeat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf no worthy end is served by a continuation, certainly.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould you feel no loss?"},{"id":4480,"text":"No wonder?"},{"id":4481,"text":"Would there be no little speck of dissatisfaction?"},{"id":4482,"text":"Frustrated curiosity?\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley\u2019s hopes, not strong in the first place, weakened as he spoke."},{"id":4483,"text":"The word \u201ccuriosity,\u201d second time repeated, brought back his own remarks to Francis Clousarr four hours before."},{"id":4484,"text":"He had known well enough then the qualities that marked off a man from a machine."},{"id":4485,"text":"Curiosity had to be one of

close to the truth."},{"id":4696,"text":"And he wasn\u2019t really worried about that."},{"id":4697,"text":"At the very beginning he did his best to arouse my distrust of you, Daneel, and make certain

way."},{"id":4708,"text":"But there\u2019s better evidence than that.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did Jessie find out Daneel was a robot?"},{"id":4709,"text":"It puzzled me at the time."},{"id":4710,"text":"Of course we know now that she found out through her Medievalist organization, but that just shoves the problem one step backward."},{"id":4711,"text":"How did they know?"},{"id":4712,"text":"You, Commissioner, dismissed it with a theory that Daneel was recognized as a robot during the incident at the shoe counter."},{"id":4713,"text":"I didn\u2019t quite believe that."},{"id":4714,"text":"I couldn\u2019t."},{"id":4715,"text":"I took him for human when I first saw him, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with my eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cYesterday, I asked Dr."},{"id":4716,"text":"Gerrigel to come in from Washington."},{"id":4717,"text":"Later I decided I needed him for several reasons, but, at the time I first called him, my only purpose was to see if he would recognize Daneel for what he was with no prompting on my part.\r\n\r\n\u201cCommissioner, he didn\u2019t!"},{"id":4718,"text":"I introduced him to Daneel, he shook hands with him, we all talked together, and it was only after the

you mean to say a few Medievalist rioters could do better than he under conditions of confusion and tension, and be so certain about it that they would throw their entire organization into activity based on the feeling that Daneel was a robot?\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious now that the Medievalists must have known Daneel to be a robot to begin with."},{"id":4722,"text":"The incident at the shoe counter was deliberately designed to show Daneel and, through him, Spacetown, the extent of anti-robot feeling in the City."},{"id":4723,"text":"It was meant to confuse the issue, to turn suspicion away from individuals and toward the population as a whole.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, if they knew the truth about Daneel to begin with, who told them?"},{"id":4724,"text":"I didn\u2019t."},{"id":4725,"text":"I once thought it was Daneel himself, but that\u2019s out."},{"id":4726,"text":"The only other Earthman who knew about it was you, Commissioner.\u201d\r\n\r\nEnderby said, with surprising energy, \u201cThere could be spies in the Department, too."},{"id":4727,"text":"The Medievalists could have us riddled with them."},{"id":4728,"text":"Your wife was one, and if you don\u2019t find it impossible that I should be one, why not others in the Department?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe corners of Baley\u2019s lips pulled back a savage trifle. \u201cLet\u2019s not bring up mysterious spies until we see where the straightforward solution leads us."},{"id":4729,"text":"I say you\u2019re the obvious informer and the real one.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting now that I look back on it, Commissioner, to see how your spirits rose and fell accordingly as I seemed to be far from a solution or possibly close to it."},{"id":4730,"text":"You were nervous to begin with."},{"id":4731,"text":"When I wanted to visit Spacetown yesterday morning and wouldn\u2019t tell you the reason, you were practically in a state of collapse."},{"id":4732,"text":"Did you think I had you pinned, Commissioner?"},{"id":4733,"text":"That it was a trap to get you into their hands?"},{"id":4734,"text":"You hated them, you told me."},{"id":4735,"text":"You were virtually in tears."},{"id":4736,"text":"For a time, I thought that to be caused by the memory of humiliation in Spacetown when you yourself were a suspect, but then Daneel told me that your sensibilities had been carefully regarded."},{"id":4737,"text":"You had never known you were a suspect."},{"id":4738,"text":"Your panic was due to fear, not humiliation.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen when I came out with my completely wrong solution, while you listened over trimensional circuit, and you saw how far, how immensely far, from the truth I was, you were confident again."},{"id":4739,"text":"You even argued with me, defended the Spacers."},{"id":4740,"text":"After that, you were quite master of yourself for a while, quite confident."},{"id":4741,"text":"It surprised me at the time that you so easily forgave my false accusations against the Spacers when earlier you had so lectured me on their sensitivity."},{"id":4742,"text":"You enjoyed my mistake.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen I put in my call for Dr."},{"id":4743,"text":"Gerrigel and you wanted to know why and I wouldn\u2019t tell you."},{"id":4744,"text":"That plunged you into the abyss again because you feared--\u201d\r\n\r\nR."},{"id":4745,"text":"Daneel suddenly raised his hand. \u201cPartner Elijah!\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley looked at his watch."},{"id":4746,"text":"23:42!"},{"id":4747,"text":"He said, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n\r\nR."},{"id":4748,"text":"Daneel said, \u201cHe might have been disturbed at thinking you would find out his Medievalist connections, if we grant their existence."},{"id":4749,"text":"There is nothing, though, to connect him with the murder."},{"id":4750,"text":"He cannot have had anything to do with that.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley said, \u201cYou\u2019re quite wrong, Daneel."},{"id":4751,"text":"He didn\u2019t know what I wanted Dr."},{"id":4752,"text":"Gerrigel for, but it was quite safe to assume that it was in connection with information about robots."},{"id":4753,"text":"This frightened the Commissioner, because a robot had an intimate connection with his greater crime."},{"id":4754,"text":"Isn\u2019t that so, Commissioner?\u201d\r\n\r\nEnderby shook his head. \u201cWhen this is over--\u201d he began, but choked into inarticulacy.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow was the murder committed?\u201d demanded Baley with a suppressed fury. \u201cC\/Fe, damn it!"},{"id":4755,"text":"C\/Fe!"},{"id":4756,"text":"I use your own term, Daneel."},{"id":4757,"text":"You\u2019re so full of the benefits of a C\/Fe culture, yet you don\u2019t see where an Earthman might have used it for at least a temporary advantage."},{"id":4758,"text":"Let me sketch it in for you.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no difficulty in the notion of a robot crossing open country."},{"id":4759,"text":"Even at night."},{"id":4760,"text":"Even alone."},{"id":4761,"text":"The Commissioner put a blaster into R."},{"id":4762,"text":"Sammy\u2019s hand, told him where to go and when."},{"id":4763,"text":"He himself entered Spacetown through the Personal and was relieved of his own blaster."},{"id":4764,"text":"He received the other from R."},{"id":4765,"text":"Sammy\u2019s hands, killed Dr."},{"id":4766,"text":"Sarton, returned the blaster to R."},{"id":4767,"text":"Sammy, who took it back across the fields to New York City."},{"id":4768,"text":"And today he destroyed R."},{"id":4769,"text":"Sammy, whose knowledge had become dangerous.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat explains everything."},{"id":4770,"text":"The presence of the Commissioner, the absence of a weapon."},{"id":4771,"text":"And it makes it unnecessary to suppose any human New Yorker had crawled a mile under the open sky at night.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut at the end of Baley\u2019s recitation, R."},{"id":4772,"text":"Daneel said, \u201cI am sorry, partner Elijah, though happy for the Commissioner, that your story explains nothing."},{"id":4773,"text":"I have told you that the cerebroanalytic properties of the Commissioner are such that it is impossible for him to have committed deliberate murder."},{"id":4774,"text":"I don\u2019t know what English word would be applied to the psychological fact: cowardice, conscience, or compassion."},{"id":4775,"text":"I know the dictionary meanings of all these, but I cannot judge."},{"id":4776,"text":"At any rate, the Commissioner did not murder.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d muttered Enderby."},{"id":4777,"text":"His voice gained strength and confidence. \u201cI don\u2019t know what your motives are, Baley, or why you should try to ruin me this way, but I\u2019ll get to the bottom--\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d said Baley. \u201cI\u2019m not through."},{"id":4778,"text":"I\u2019ve got this.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe slammed the aluminum cube on Enderby\u2019s desk, and tried to feel the confidence he hoped he was radiating."},{"id":4779,"text":"For half an hour now, he had been hiding from himself one little fact: that he did not know what the picture showed."},{"id":4780,"text":"He was gambling, but it was all that was left to do."},{"id":4781,"text":"Enderby shrank away from the small object. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t a bomb,\u201d said Baley, sardonically. \u201cJust an ordinary microprojector.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell?"},{"id":4782,"text":"What will that prove?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSuppose we see.\u201d His fingernail probed at one of the slits in the cube, and a corner of the Commissioner\u2019s office blanked out, then lit up in an alien scene in three dimensions."},{"id":4783,"text":"It reached from floor to ceiling and extended out past the walls of the room."},{"id":4784,"text":"It was awash with a gray light of a sort the City\u2019s utilities never provided."},{"id":4785,"text":"Baley thought, with a pang of mingled distaste and perverse attraction: It must be the dawn they talk about."},{"id":4786,"text":"The pictured scene was of Dr."},{"id":4787,"text":"Sarton\u2019s dome."},{"id":4788,"text":"Dr."},{"id":4789,"text":"Sarton\u2019s dead body, a horrible, broken remnant, filled its center."},{"id":4790,"text":"Enderby\u2019s eyes bulged as he stared."},{"id":4791,"text":"Baley said, \u201cI know the Commissioner isn\u2019t a killer."},{"id":4792,"text":"I don\u2019t need you to tell me that, Daneel."},{"id":4793,"text":"If I could have gotten around that one fact earlier, I would have had the solution earlier."},{"id":4794,"text":"Actually, I didn\u2019t see a way out of it until an hour ago when I carelessly said to you that you had once been curious about Bentley\u2019s contact lenses.--That was it, Commissioner."},{"id":4795,"text":"It occurred to me then that your nearsightedness and your glasses were the key."},{"id":4796,"text":"They don\u2019t have nearsightedness on the Outer Worlds, I suppose, or they might have reached the true solution of the murder almost at once."},{"id":4797,"text":"Commissioner, when did you break your glasses?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley said, \u201cWhen I first saw you about this case, you told me you had broken your glasses in Spacetown."},{"id":4798,"text":"I assumed that you broke them in your agitation on hearing the news of the murder, but you never said so, and I had no reason for making that assumption."},{"id":4799,"text":"Actually, if you were entering Spacetown with crime on your mind, you were already sufficiently agitated to drop and break your glasses before the murder."},{"id":4800,"text":"Isn\u2019t that so, and didn\u2019t that, in fact, happen?\u201d\r\n\r\nR."},{"id":4801,"text":"Daneel said, \u201cI do not see the point, partner Elijah.\u201d\r\n\r\nBaley thought: I\u2019m partner Elijah for ten minutes more."},{"id":4802,"text":"Fast!"},{"id":4803,"text":"Talk fast!"},{"id":4804,"text":"And think fast!"},{"id":4805,"text":"He was manipulating Sarton\u2019s dome image as he spoke."},{"id":4806,"text":"Clumsily, he expanded it, his fingernails unsure in the tension that was overwhelming him."},{"id":4807,"text":"Slowly, in jerks, the corpse widened, broadened, heightened, came closer."},{"id":4808,"text":"Baley could almost smell the stench of its scorched flesh."},{"id":4809,"text":"Its head, shoulders, and one upper arm lolled crazily, connected to hips and legs by a blackened remnant of spine from which charred rib stumps jutted."},{"id":4810,"text":"Baley cast a side glance at the Commissioner."},{"id":4811,"text":"Enderby had closed his eyes."},{"id":4812,"text":"He looked sick."},{"id":4813,"text":"Baley felt sick, too, but he had to look."},{"id":4814,"text":"Slowly he circled the trimensional image by means of the transmitter controls, rotating it, bringing the ground about the corpse to view in successive quadrants."},{"id":4815,"text":"His fingernail slipped and the imaged floor tilted suddenly and expanded till floor and corpse alike were a hazy mass, beyond the resolving power of the transmitter."},{"id":4816,"text":"He brought the expansion down, let the corpse slide away."},{"id":4817,"text":"He was still talking."},{"id":4818,"text":"He had to."},{"id":4819,"text":"He couldn\u2019t stop till he found what he was looking for."},{"id":4820,"text":"And if he didn\u2019t, all his talk might be useless."},{"id":4821,"text":"Worse than useless."},{"id":4822,"text":"His heart was throbbing, and so was his head."},{"id":4823,"text":"He said, \u201cThe Commissioner can\u2019t commit deliberate murder."},{"id":4824,"text":"True!"},{"id":4825,"text":"Deliberate."},{"id":4826,"text":"But any man can kill by accident."},{"id":4827,"text":"The Commissioner didn\u2019t enter Spacetown to kill Dr."},{"id":4828,"text":"Sarton."},{"id":4829,"text":"He came in to kill you, Daneel, you!"},{"id":4830,"text":"Is there anything in his cerebroanalysis that says he is incapable of wrecking a machine?"},{"id":4831,"text":"That\u2019s not murder, merely sabotage.\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is a Medievalist, an earnest one."},{"id":4832,"text":"He worked with Dr."},{"id":4833,"text":"Sarton and knew the purpose for which you were designed, Daneel."},{"id":4834,"text":"He feared that purpose might be achieved, that Earthmen would eventually be weaned away from Earth."},{"id":4835,"text":"So he decided to destroy you, Daneel."},{"id":4836,"text":"You were the only one of your type manufactured as yet and he had good reason to think that by demonstrating the extent and determination of Medievalism on Earth, he would discourage the Spacers."},{"id":4837,"text":"He knew how strong popular opinion was on the Outer Worlds to end the Spacetown project altogether."},{"id":4838,"text":"Dr."},{"id":4839,"text":"Sarton must have discussed that with him."},{"id":4840,"text":"This, he thought, would be the last nudge in the proper direction.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t say even the thought of killing you, Daneel, was a pleasant one."},{"id":4841,"text":"He would have had R."},{"id":4842,"text":"Sammy do it, I imagine, if you didn\u2019t look so human that a primitive robot such as Sammy could not have told the difference, or understood it."},{"id":4843,"text":"First Law would stop him."},{"id":4844,"text":"Or the Commissioner would have had another human do it if he, himself, were not the only one who had ready access to Spacetown at all times.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet me reconstruct what the Commissioner\u2019s plan might have been."},{"id":4845,"text":"I\u2019m guessing, I admit, but I think I\u2019m close."},{"id":4846,"text":"He made the appointment with Dr."},{"id":4847,"text":"Sarton, but deliberately came early, at dawn, in fact."},{"id":4848,"text":"Dr."},{"id":4849,"text":"Sarton would be sleeping, I imagine, but you, Daneel, would be awake."},{"id":4850,"text":"I assume, by the way, you were living

come to the dome door, Daneel, receive a blaster charge in the chest or head, and be done with."},{"id":4853,"text":"The Commissioner would leave quickly, through the deserted streets of Spacetown\u2019s dawn, and back to where R."},{"id":4854,"text":"Sammy waited."},{"id":4855,"text":"He would give him back the blaster, then slowly walk again to Dr."},{"id":4856,"text":"Sarton\u2019s
